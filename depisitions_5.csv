the X 1150  What was the reason if you recall  Mr  Black Mirror for the use of the working type of boats fishing or tugboats as opposed to pleasure craft in developing a visual Team theme oriented towards the city for the Winston lights  To the best of my recollection  Mr  Sobel  it would have it would have been done for the reason that Winston smoker  Tends to be in contrast to for example Marlboro might have tended at that time to be somewhat more downscale somewhat more of a working class individual  Was the see visual theme developed for the Winston lights geared towards a demographic group based upon say average household income  How was the sea motif  targeted Towards a specific demographic group  Probably wasser  And what was that demographic group  I don t recall specifically  Do you recall  The FTC tar level of the Winston lights at this time that you were developing the new Winston lights campaign with the visual theme  of the sea motif I can only Hazard a guess sir  Your call whether or not it was lower than the Winston Brand  Almost sure it was and recall the specific numbers  Do you recall the FTC nicotine yield of the Winston light cigarette the time that you were developing this new campaign based upon a visual C theme  Do you recall whether or not the FTC nicotine yield was lower for the Winston lights than the regular Winston s  Not specifically  but I d be surprised if it wasn t  Was the nicotine yield to the smoker based upon ft  C   method or some other method and all part of the basis for the copy  What you say was used in connection with this visual C theme of no compromise  I m reasonably certain that it was not  Do you recall whether or not  RJ Reynolds tobacco conducted Test to determine the nicotine yield to smokers  Smoking Winston lights at that time Could you repeat the question  please  You know whether our Jr  Tobacco conducted tests to determine the nicotine yield  From smoking Winston lights in or about the time that you develop the new campaign direction to the questions and big risks  I mean what kind of tests are you asking him advertising test or your edging asking him for affiliate  Let me let me break it down  Okay  because he s obviously not in our D but When you were brand manager  Back in the mid late 70s  Did you review time to time  Data concerning FTC method measurements for the brands for which you are responsible  I did Sir  And did those did you all strike that did you review from time to time RJ our tobacco  Originated test concerning nicotine yield of the cigarettes for which you were responsible  No  sir  I don t believe I do  Where did the data come from that you did with you  Is best about as I recall  No reason for which the Marketing Group would have needed to know that was for insertion in each of our advertisers  More than likely it came from  What was what was it that time much like called the the FTC report  Which was a shoe periodically  All right  what you do after you were brand manager  I joined one of our affiliate companies  RJ Reynolds  Tobacco International  what s what s its name  When was that  It s best  I recall was in March of 1980  And how long were you  with RJ r   tobacco International His best are call  It was July of 1987  And I left  Archery or International you hold more than one position while you re with tobacco International  I did Sir  What was the first position you held so should call the area Marketing Manager What were your responsibilities is area Marketing Manager  First firstly I should probably point out that that would been more what we would refer to as a staff position as opposed to having having line marketing accountabilities for any specific product line or any specific geographic area  I served as they are a marketing manager for our Asia Pacific  period And what did your responsibilities and tail in that regard  Mr  Solo included things like  Consulting with local markets on their marketing activities often they would ask for assistance in that regard and I might travel to that market work with the local Marketing Manager  terms of a strategy to help monitor campaign development Probably other duties as well  That was the that was the primary Duty  For the asia pacific well back up a little bit the asia pacific market  What did that encompass  the best of my recollection geographically it would have spanned from the market of Japan South to Market of Australia it was more or less a north south kind of kind of alignment primary markets in which we Did business at the time included Hong Kong  Malaysia AustraliaThere are probably a few others in his those were been the primary markets at the time  Where the marketing strategies for the ASA asia pacific markets developed overseas or here in Winston Salem  Direct to the question is ambiguous to the word Winston Salem  The international company does have air had its headquarters here in Winston Salem  I just want to be careful to draw the line between International activities and the Reynolds activities amount of want to go overboard with the international area  If you want to find out a little bit about what he did on the international front  let s do it  Just want to know how it works  So I ll ask you how did it work  How did the marketing strategy implementation  For the asia pacific market generally speaking  It was driven by the by the local markets at the time  now some of those instances you may see you might have seen advertising that looked similar perhaps even identical to that which was it might have been running in the United States  but that those decisions tend to be made within the local markets  Would you have final  strike that would during this time that you were an area Marketing Manager for our Jr  Tobacco International  Did you have any domestic responsibilities  Not that I recall  Did you during that time participate in the development of any marketing plans marketing strategies for any Brands which were implemented domestically  No  it s a fair to say that the international market took its lead from the domestic Market  in terms of marketing strategy No  sir  I don t think it s fair  So  How is it that the international market  wood contained employ similar identical advertisements that were used domestically  Let me rephrase my question was how is it that our Jr  Tobacco International Wood  Implement similar or identical marketing strategies or advertisements that were used domestically  I guess the core answer that question  Mr  Sobel is that many of the brand names were more similar or identical  What about marketing themes I m not sure  I understand what you re asking  Where was our Jr  Tobacco International located during the time that you were  An area marketing manager  Are you asking where their headquarters  Yes  It was in Winston Salem  North Carolina  And is that where your office was  No  sir  Where was your office  How often would you communicate with the headquarters in Winston Salem  Headquarters of Arts are international  Yes  By communicate you Main telephone discussions  Maybe once a week on on average  perhaps a greater frequency for telegraphic communication  What you do after  You are area marketing manager  What was the next position you had a tobacco International basically in the same role  Mr  So why was promoted area marketing director and vice president of marketing for with essentially the same responsibilities  and after you left  tobacco International Jew come back to work for rkr tobacco I did but you re skipping  Okay  what did you do after you you became after you finished with September 1982  I moved to Puerto Rico still with RJ Reynolds  Tobacco International  We responsibilities primarily the same that is Consulting with local markets and know certain that instance  It was more of what would be termed a line marketing Association specific accountability for Mark and the companies brands on the island of Puerto Rico  And which brands were you responsible for all of our Jr  s Brands  Yes objection to ambiguous RJR in rgr to pack  Our national what were the brand names you were responsible for when you were stationed in Puerto Rico  our primary brands in Puerto Rico where Winston Salem and camel and there are others with knew there were they were not primary branches  And how long were you in Puerto Rico  September of 1980 22 Early  January 1996 if I m sorry getting my decades mixed up if I can t let me clarify that it September  1982 2 I believe it was early January 1990 Excuse Me 1986 doing it  So approximately three and a half years  And while you were in Puerto Rico  were you responsible for developing marketing strategies and advertising content  For the primarily Winston Salem and Campbell brands  Yes  And in connection with that responsibility  did you review the domestic marketing strategies  Employed by our Jr  Tobacco For Those Brands not wouldn t have done that as a routine matter  Did you make any effort to ensure that you the marketing strategies which you ve developed for those three brands while you were in Puerto Rico  We re not in conflict with the marketing strategies developed for those Brands domestically by RJ R Tobacco I m not I m not sure  I understand the not in Conflict aspect of your question  sir  Did you make any efforts to ensure that the marketing strategies which you developed for Winston Salem and camel and Puerto Rico were consistent with the marketing strategies  For those three brands that were employed domestically by RJ are tobacco  I don t recall having been involved in that activity  Who did you report to when you were in Puerto Rico  Mr  Clyde Fitzgerald anyone else  No  sir  What was his title  His title was president I believe it was RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company  I think it s chartered in a different state than the RJ Reynolds tobacco company is into its I believe a subsidiary of the division of RJ Reynolds  Tobacco International at the time  I think it has a it is Incorporated in Delaware as opposed to the Tobacco Company being Incorporated in time  So leave that s correct  But I think there s a slight difference in their name  I m not sure what it is  Well  why don t you tell me what the marketing strategy was for Winston  That you developed during your period in Puerto Rico To Repose question  please  What was the marketing strategy you developed or executed in connection with the Winston Brand while you are in Puerto Rico  Fundamentally Winston was pretty successful  Branding in Puerto Rico  So we were in a mode of Continuing if you will the the execution is opposed to developing new strategies for Winston  What was the marketing strategy in place for Winston in Puerto Rico  Marketing strategy and the theme of the advertising was was oriented toward associating  Winston s popularity with the with the island of Puerto Rico the advertising copy in Spanish was It s no way to directly translated  Winston and Puerto Rico There is or there are nothing better  It s the same translation back translated into Spanish  It would be exactly the same  What was your position  Your title when you were in Puerto  Rico vice president marketing  And as VP of marketing that time at that time stationed in Puerto Rico  did you have an understanding of whether or not Winston cigarettes were  The sale of Winston cigarettes were targeted towards a specific demographic group domestically  I didn t answer  Did you have an understanding whether Winston cigarettes were targeted to a specific demographic group  In Puerto Rico during that time  If so to what demographic group is  As I recall  it would have been I m not entirely certain about this as I recall  It would have been 18 to 49  smokers age wise males and femalesAre you aware of any demographic group  Which would not Encompass 18 to 49 year old smokers males or females for which any marketing strategy or any advertising which you are aware and your 28 years at RJ Reynolds addressed I can t recall  Specifically whether there was anything outside of those bounds my aunt and my only hesitation on that  mr  Solo is on the upper end of that age range Do you recall whether or not  Straight that did you have an understanding  Of whether or not the Salem brand was targeted to a specific demographic group  In Puerto Rico during the time that you were the VP of marketing  I m sure it would have been sir  And what was that Democratic rip  I don t recall precisely  Do you have a general understanding of what that demographic group with it  I d only be hazarding a guess  If any general recollection of what the demographic group was my general Recs let you finish I have issues  Do you have any recollection whatsoever of what the demographic group was  that RJ are tobacco International targeted in connection with the Salem brand during the time that you were VP of marketing and Puerto Rico  My general recognition would be that it would be that it may well have been 18 to 34 year old male and female smokers  You recall  Any reasons why they Salem targeted demographic group was different than the Winston targeted demographic group in Puerto Rico during the time that you were Vice President of marketing ,0.83634065387878787,PM12 06 PM12 16 PM12 04  MAY  19 1998 PM12

indicated that in 2008 you and Kathy Stewart essentially switched jobs  So you went to dosage products and she went to bulk narcotics  That s correct  Why did you switch  Our boss of time George tafel wanted us to switch to learn more about the other areas  And the other area is meaning he wanted you to learn more about dosage products and her to learn more about that s all correct products  right  Did George have any concerns about Kathy s stewardship of the dosage products  Yeah  And would you view your your switch in 2008 as a promotion for you know  it was a lateral  Now  do we call our prior discussion regarding the quota system  Yes  and so I want to focus now on bulk narcotics with respect to the quota system  Well  I guess what why are quotas important  Quotas are important and I again I m speaking as a customer service person  I m not you know privy to all the the regulations that like Aaron Harper into compliance group would would be but from what I remember the quota system was important in for the DEA to keep track of what was being  Use in the United States  So like I mentioned earlier the da would take all the quota all the all the quota  Letters and forms and 2222 Farms that were perused and I m not only talking  you know from the Distributors  but also from the the pharmacist and everyone else that had to report to the DA what they were using during the year  They would take that add it all up and see what the total was for United States for a particular  Product and they would use that for their base for what they were going to allow the following year  So that s why the reporting through the quota system was very very important  And you had indicated that the the compliance with the quota system was an element of Mallinckrodt efforts to fight diversion  Is that fair  Well  I wouldn t say it was that you know  it was to meet the regulations that were given to us by the DEA as as a good citizen Malachi being a good citizen  We felt it was very important that we follow the regulations in that to keep something like diversion happening  And so what are what are all of the steps focusing now on the bulk narcotics  Side  what are all the steps that Mallinckrodt took to ensure that the quota system was being complied with we would we would require from our customers along with their order to send us a quart of warm under their license  whether they re a manufacturer or a researcher or whatever license  They had they had to send us a quote a farm and we would not use we could not ship that otter until that farm was sent to us and what we would do with with the quota Farms then turn that into our compliance group  And did the did the quota form indicate their overall quota for the year No  usually it was the amount that they were ordering  It couldn t be more than what was on the otter  And so how how would Mallinckrodt know that this order that the order that the newest ordered  Your customer had submitted didn t exceed their quota for the year  It would show the total  I believe if I m not and I m trying to remember I think it would show the total but then it would also show what they were using for that particular order and when you say total  I m sorry  What total are you referring to  You were asking what how we knew what the customers final was  My apologies  Let me rephrase that question  The quota form would show the total amount of that narcotic  They had received that year that they were ordering from us  Okay understood  but I guess my question may be a little different  So let s say the da gives manufacturer a a quota of 100 kg and Mallinckrodt and they submit an order to Mallinckrodt asking to purchase three kilograms  Okay  How does Mallinckrodt know  But whether that 3 Kg order is going to exceed their hundred kilogram quota  It would show the total and then what had been used so far  So the quote of what I remember  So your recollection is that the quota form is going to show their overall quota  So 100 kg plus the amount that they had ordered up  So the total amount they had ordered thus far for the year  I believe so from what I remember and was that just orders from Mallinckrodt was that all orders be all orders  So if Manufacturer a were ordering  you know bulk product from Mallinckrodt and three other manufacturers the quota form is going to show the total amount  They had received from all of those other manufacturers  And did Mallinckrodt take any steps to ensure that those numbers were for accurate  Customer service was a responsible for that so we would turn into forms to our compliance group  So that would be for them to determine that they reported through their system  which was Darko system  which I m not that familiar with but that s how they reported what the manufacturer are our customers add taken  From us or sold to them from us  And our kids would tell you how much our crews would give you the amount of product that the manufacturer had obtained from Mallinckrodt  Would it also provide you with the information as to how much they had obtained from everyone else  I would have to refer you to Karen Harper on that  And going over to the dosage side  What was the system in place on the dosage side to ensure that the quota system was being complied with  The customer had to give us a 22 to form that match the order quantity that they are ordering and that to to farm would then sent be sent to our compliance person and they would gather all that those compliance Farms  I believe on a monthly basis and send them to the DEA  But then again  that s the compliance group and I would refer you to them for more information and did the 22 to form also contain the total quota assigned to that if it did but I remember it was just for that particular order  So I guess going back to my question from the bulk side with respect to the dosage side of the business  How did Mallinckrodt know that well strike  That so let s take the following hypothetical distributor a has a quota from the a for 100 pills  It s a Mitzvah to to to form to Mallinckrodt asking to buy 10 pills  How does Mallinckrodt know that those ten pills don t exceed the hundred pill quota  We probably wouldn t but remember that the DEA is issuing the 22 to farm  So they as we turn in our we and whoever else they re buying from the 222 Farms back to the DEA the DEA would give them new to to Farms based upon  On what was left And you know how DEA set the quotas  No  that would be like Aaron Harper question  But you would agree that it s very important to comply with that quota system  Oh  yes So we previously spoke about diversion and you recall that yes  and is it your understanding that Mallinckrodt products were being diverted  Is it my understanding  Not that I m aware of  I ve just from what I guess from  I heard from the news  Well  but you ve seen news reports indicating that Mallinckrodt products have been diverted that there  Yes  And you recall what those news reports said  No  not really  But your understanding from these news reports is that Mallinckrodt products were being diverted and they were being abused  Is that fair  correct  Are you familiar with the term Ms  Ms  Ms  No  I m not  What about Molly s Molly s I ve heard of them  but I don t know specifically what they are  Are you familiar  Are you familiar with any terms or any references to mallik Road products with respect to being street drugs  No  So given that Mallinckrodt products were being diverted and they were being abused  Are there any additional steps looking back in hindsight that you feel Mallinckrodt should have taken well  just want to Say that if you if you remember where we were in the chain of a manufacturing if we re talking about balke at this time  where we talking about 2007 are we talking generic  Well  let s time frame  Let s start with dosage products and then we can go to okay  Okay  keep in mind that the generic business we were  you know  we had our own regulations in place of meeting the The requirements plus we develop our suspicious are monitoring program  which was another step of identifying orders that may have been out of order or suspicious quantities  And when we sold those sold our product they went to Distributors who were supposed to have their own suspicious are monitoring programs and Place and then they sold to druggist and then too Physicians and then to the end user  So there is a quite a number of people in between Mallinckrodt and the end user  So I would say that we did our due diligence in trying to keep the version from happening  And when you say due diligence  what do you mean by that bye bye meeting the requirements  of the DEAAnd so it was very important to you that Mallinckrodt meet these da requirements  I d say it s probably the most important thing that we did  And this view was widely shared at the company  It s a grass it was  I will add that when we were developing our suspicious our program that that was rolled out to our marketing people and also our sales force on what our requirements were and what their part would be going forward in helping us on on controlling any any possible suspicious otters are Tires as we became became known as later on  How did you know that you re suspicious order monitoring program was effective  We did not have one suspicious otter  While I was doing the job and when you say you did not have one suspicious order while you were doing the job  What do you mean by that  Well  just to talk about a little bit about the suspicious art of program that we develop in order would be flagged every day an order could be flagged on a daily basis as being suspicious  Our peculiar as we called it and what that is is just a stage that we went through if an artery was flagged as being peculiar  It was during my time my my job or responsibility to talk to marketing are our customer service reps who would be the first people that I would talk to because they were in tune to our customers and what their order needs were and they would know if there was anything unusual as are as a distributor picking up a new customer that they had and had before that they would now need increased material to supply and if our CSR did not have a answer to why the customer was ordering more I would go to the product manager our business manager whatever they were being called at the time who is had that particular product that the order was far and I would ask them if they knew why all of a sudden we were having a peculiar art from that at customer and A peculiar odor again would be unusual quantity from what they have bought in the past over a period of time based upon the logarithms that we set in place in our computer system  If they didn t know am I Next Step would be going to the salesperson and asking them  And so when you say that you didn t have any suspicious orders though  Well  what do you mean  What do you mean by that suspicious are is one that would be where there is  Possible where we could not identify for whatever reason what reason the customer was ordering more than what they had in the past that would become a suspicious order and we report that to care and Harper and her group who would then reported to the DEA  And so and I just want to try to understand what your testimony is  Are you saying that because none of your customers ever submitted a suspicious ordered to you that you re suspicious order monitoring program was effective  I m saying that during the time that I was running the program and working the program that we did not have a suspicious otter  And when you say you did not have a suspicious order that means that you didn t identify any orders that were suspicious  We identified ours or peculiar  but we could explain them and then that go to the point of being a suspicious order and I guess my question is and you ve indicated that you could explain all of your peculiar orders  How do you know that that your explanations were in fact  correct because in identifying the why the order was being Determine the game peculiar  We had an elf a legitimate explanation of why the otter was larger or peculiar from what it had been in the past increase sales a new customer was coming aboard that the customer of ours had gotten they were explainable orders is what I m saying  So therefore they went to Peculiar to Play Jim a daughter  And the explanation you are getting though was ultimately being provided by the customers that accurate  by the by the swell from the salesman are from marketing are to product manager in dealing with the customer  So they would get the information from the customer and really it to you at that  Yes  Was there ever a circumstance where a customer lied to one of your sales reps  I don t know that  If the customer lied to your sales rep than in fact  the the order would not be legitimate  Is that correct  that s possible  but what I m saying that from when I was working at We were we were satisfied with explanations that we were receiving from our sales force and the marketing Folks at why the order was legitimate  Are you familiar with the compensation scheme for your Salesforce  No  I m not  Do you know if they re bonus was dependent in any way on the number of sales they made well  I would guess it s sales would be involved but keep in mind that the sales force were very aware of the DEA compliance that Mallinckrodt enforced and they knew it could lead to firing our us losing our license to manufacturing cell  So Is a high priority for us over and Beyond sales  What s the Salesforce is compensation based upon their complete strike that  Was a salesforce s compensation in any way based upon their compliance with the DEA regulations  I can t I can t answer that  I don t know  So I d like to mark this as exhibit one  Sartre and Let me give a copy you Rocky go actually  here s there s another one for the team  And actually this this exhibit one is goes in connection with exhibit to so I m going to mark that as well Mr  Rauch  I ve handed you to exhibits  The first one is an email chain  And it Bears the Bates number M  NK T 127 3559  That s exhibit 1  And then I ve also provided you with an exhibit marked exhibit to this is a letter from the DEA and it s dated September 27 2006 and it Bears the Bates number M and K T 127 3563  Okay  Do you have both exhibit sir  I do okay  and so directing your attention to the email at the very top of the email chain answer  Which what exhibit one on exhibit 1  Okay  Do you see the second paragraph  That s hurts  Please note the Vince came in and I had a conversation  Yes  okay  And this is an email from Karen Harper  but she s indicating that she shared a DEA letter with you  Do you see that  Correct  Okay and exhibit to I believe is that letter which one can look at that  Yes  Could you look at that  Okay  Do you recall Karen Harper sharing this letter from you with you  I don t okay  just because I don t remember saying it s been a long time  But do you recall receiving this letter at some point  I don t recall it  but that doesn t mean I didn t receive it  Okay Do you recall ever reviewing a letter like this  Yes  And why did you review this letter  Can I take a look at it  Yes  It s actually why don t you review that letter and let me know when you re ready  Okay Okay  So directing your attention to the second page of this letter I Bears the bait summer 2735 64 you see the third paragraph from the bottom starts with us in addition  Okay  and can you read that paragraph into the record for me thus in addition to reporting all suspicious otters a distributor has a statutory responsibility to exercise due diligence to avoid filling suspicious ours that might be diverted into other legitimate medical scientific and Industrial channels failure to exercise such due diligence could as circumstances warrant provide a statutory statutory basis for Revocation or suspension of the Distributors registration now  did you understand that that legal requirement also applied to Mallinckrodt as a manufacturer check to the floor  Yes  and then do you see in the the paragraph beneath that it says a distributor may not simply rely on the fact that the person placing the suspicious order is a DEA registrant and turn a blind eye to the suspicious circumstances  Do you understand that 20c required also apply to Mallinckrodt as a manufacturer  Yes  then turning to page 3 of the memo and two circumstances that might be indicative of diversion in identify for poor circumstances  Would you agree that those circumstances are ones that are indicative of diversion  Certain pharmacies have engaged in this passing controls  Those are for circumstances that could lead to Diversion  Yes  and so if a distributor of a Distributors order fell within one of these four circumstances You would agree that that is potentially a suspicious order would you not  We kill your daughter  Yes  Then below that there s a there s a paragraph below that with 10 questions  Do you see that  Yes  So the first question is what percentage of the pharmacies business does dispensing Controlled Substances constitute  Would you agree that that is important information to to have and evaluating whether an order is suspicious for the distributor  Yes  I would say yes  and then if you were to change this question  so that would be what percentage of the distributor s business dispensing Controlled Substances constitute  Would you agree that that s important information for Mallinckrodt to have with respect to its customer  Yes  And so for number 2  It says it s a pharmacy complying with the laws of every state in which it is dispensing Controlled Substances  If you were to substitute  you know  one of my lacrosse customers and for pharmacy  would you agree that s important information for Mallinckrodt to have yes  So looking at these  I guess the remaining 10 questions and an effort to try to truncate things  Would you agree that all of these questions as apply to Malik rats customers are important information for Mallinckrodt to have in assessing whether an order is peculiar  back to the Forum No  not all of them would apply to our business of selling to Distributors  which ones would not apply  Well does the pharmacy fill prescriptions issued by practitioners  Based solely on an online questionnaire  Without a medical exam or Bonafide doctor patient relationship  Do you want me to go through all of them and tell you which ones I don t think what apply  Yes  I think that d be helpful  So I have number 5 and then number threenumber four Number yeah  number 8 is something that we wouldn t when be part of number 9 number 10 and your basis for identifying these is because Mallinckrodt doesn t do business directly with pharmacies  is that correct  That s correct  Okay does malloc Rock do business with with retail pharmacies though  For example  you know CVS or Walgreens with chains with Pharmacy chains  right  And so if a pharmacy chain fell into any one of these six categories with when that be of concern to Mallinckrodt object to the formI would guess so so for example if you had a retail pharmacy that was soliciting buyers of Controlled Substances via the Internet or is a pharmacy associated with the internet that s less its orders for controlled substances  That would be of concern to Malik Rock  What a not  Yes  okay  And modifying that question  If you were if one of your Distributors was doing business with for example a pharmacy or an Internet site affiliated with the pharmacy offering to facilitate the acquisition of a prescription for a controlled substance from a practitioner with whom the buyer has no pre existing relationship  Wouldn t that be of concern to you  We sold to Distributors not to your question was about the distributor  Well  no  I m sorry  Let me rephrase that  My question is now about the distributor s customers  Okay  so you ve got a list here of 10 essentially  Would it be fair to call these red flags  Yes  Okay  So you ve got a question  You ve got a list here of 10 red flags if he distributor is doing business with a pharmacy that raises one or more red flags  Wouldn t that be of concern  Mallinckrodt jump to the Forum  Well  it would be a red flag for the distributor who also has a suspicious are monitoring program  That should be in place  Okay  We were we were not monitoring our customers customer at this time  We were asked to to monitor  Our customers are build a report suspicious our program on our customers  You said you re not monitoring them at this time  Well  okay  we weren t monitoring them what I when I had this back in 2007 when I was in our 2006 actually when I didn t I was in the bulk area not in the dosage area  but our program was based upon the customers that we were selling to  Not who the customers customers were selling to we didn t have that information available to us at that time  And you know if I make myself clear  well  I think so  but I want to make sure that I okay what you re saying  So with respect to the bulk area  which is prior to 2006 which is prior to 2007  This letter is dated 2006  You re saying that from from the standpoint of the bulk narcotics business  Yes  You were not looking at your customers customer  That s that s correct  And keep in mind back then  We were sending a monthly letter to the DA office  Which I think I buy talked about earlier and in our conversation that was a requirement of the DEA at that time in 2006 and I believe into 2007 and then the da was telling us through our compliance group is where we were getting the information like this and then in talks with her that the letter was no longer needed  They didn t want to see the letter  They wanted us to start developing a program which we would call our ongoing are suspicious our monitoring program  which we worked on for a period of time and was put in place in the end of 2008  Well from the Paulk the bulk business  We were monitoring our customers not their customers  But Mallinckrodt had the capability of monitoring your customers customers did not On the bulk business  No  not that I am aware of did it have the ability to do so on the dosage side  From a customer service perspective  No  Well  you indicated a customer service perspective  I guess I would ask we did not have the resources to identify who our customer who our customer were selling to and when you say resources you re talking about you didn t have enough employees  you know  No we did not have the data information available to us that I m aware of  On the either on the dosage side or on the bulk side  Well  are we bouncing back and forth well on the box  I we certainly did not okay  So on the bolt side  you did not have you do not have the data that would allow you to know who your customers customer was Rocky now turning to the dosage side  which I did not have at that time  Understood but turning to the dosage side prior to 2007 right  Did Mal are you aware  Well  it s right that did Mallinckrodt have the ability to monitor its customers customer  I was not aware if it was or not  And when you say you re not aware you is that is strike that you don t know one way or the other  Is that fair  correct  What Kathy Stewart  No  Jeff to the floor  I can t answer that  I don t know what Kathy would know about it  But in any event Mallinckrodt was not monitoring its customers customer on the dosage side prior to 2007  As far as I know they were not they were they were doing the same thing  The bulk side was do doing would you agree though that from a standpoint of diversion control and diversion prevention  It would be helpful to know your customers customer  I can t answer that  I don t I don t know the answer to that from a diversion  I mean I keep in mind I want to reiterate that  We were not the only player in this this closed loop where we were selling to our customer  Our customer was supposed to be monitoring their customer all the way down to the pharmacist and the doctor  Well  but I have a slightly different question which is you know  a distributor is Distributing to let s say internet pharmacies that are just for filling prescriptions  you know over the Internet  It s a soliciting orders over than internet and that is a an area of concern  That s one of the red flags raised in this 2006 letters and not yes  Okay  So you ve got a distributor and you know that distributor is doing business with those types of pharmacies isn t that of Mallinckrodt I think that s one of the reasons we put in our program on the deviation of otters that were coming from our customers to show if there was a suspicious order there  We couldn t tell who they were selling to at that time  If you re if you re asking me that I think do I feel that knowing our customers customer  Would benefit Malin crowd or benefit the diversion that s possible  I bet I can answer that for for sure  Well if Mallinckrodt though had the ability to monitor its customers customer  That was that hypothetically  Hypothetically if they had the ability to do that  Would you agree that it would have been helpful to Diversion control for them to do so that s right to the floor  Yes  it would be helpful  Do you believe it should have been required  I can answer that we were meeting the requirements that I felt were in place at the time  That s a that s a Karen Harper question  So turning now  I m going to focus your attention on two other two more exhibits  And so I m marking these in tandem as exhibit 3 and Exhibits for I m sorry  this is exhibit 3 and it Bears the Bates number M and Katie 14 1987 for and while I m labeling things I m going to post a label exhibit for this is a key a letter and if there s the Bates number M and Katie 1421 084Okay  you want me to read this so you won t fit so actually I just have a few quick questions on this cover email  Okay  but it is an email to from Kevin Harper to Kathy Stewart  Do you see the second email that stated the second email from the top date of March 12 2008  Okay  Yes  I d references attached information that Karen had sent to you and Michael Feeny who is Michael Finney  Michael Feeney was my boss at the time  And believe the attachments on the attachment to this email  Is this December 27 2007 letter  So if I could well  do you recall Karen Harper sending you this this letter  No  I don t  Okay  Actually  I m sorry if you look at the very bottom of the page  there s an email from Karen Harper dated January 4 2008 and you are you re one of the CCS  You see that  Yes  Okay  Do you recall Karen Harper sending you this email  No  it s been do you have any reason to doubt that she sent you this even though I don t okay  and could you please review the December 27 2007 letter believe that s exhibit for Okay  Okay  So do you recall reviewing this letter when you were employed by Mallinckrodt  I recall it  Okay  so directing your attention to the third paragraph from the top of the first page of the letter  Okay  So the regulation also requires that the registrant inform the local DEA Division office of suspicious orders when discovered by the registrar Okay  filing a monthly report of completed transactions EG an excessive purchase report or high unit purchases does not meet the regulatory requirement to report suspicious orders registrants are reminded that the responsibility does not end merely with the filled with the filing of a suspicious order report  Registrants must conduct an independent analysis of suspicious orders prior to completing a sale to determine whether the controlled substances are likely to be diverted from legitimate channels  Do you understand that language  Yes  And is that is that a correct statement of Mallinckrodt responsibilities under the law  Yes  okay  Further on down at State s regulation specifically states that suspicious orders include orders of an unusual size orders deviating substantially from a normal pattern and Orders of an unusual frequency these criteria are disjunctive and not all and are not all inclusive  Do you see that  Yes  and you understand what that means  Yes  and is that an accurate statement of what a suspicious order is Yes  And then some okay at the very bottom of that paragraph  It says the size of an order alone  whether it whether or not it deviates from a normal pattern is enough to trigger the registrants responsibility to report the order as suspicious  The determination of whether an order is suspicious depends not only on the ordering patterns of the particular customer  but also on the patterns of the registrants customer base and the patterns throughout the relevant segments of the regulated industry  Do you see that statement  I do and you agree with it  Yes  and so you understood this to be a accurate statement of Mallinckrodt legal responsibilities with respect to suspicious orders from the bulk side  which is where I was at this time  This was where we started from  What I remember the our St  Louis field office did not want to receive the monthly report any longer  Okay  and We were instructed caring Harper and Michael Feeney and some other folks put together a team of people to come up with a more robust suspicious otter monitoring program  which included myself Kathy Karen Harper oversaw  but she didn t need come to all the meetings  We had a few  Kuwaiti people that which involved to come up with a more robust authoring suspicious order monitoring program that would identify otters as being peculiar as the orders came through this was developed over time period of like 2000 and In the 2000 2008 time period and put in place and this I guess you would call us  This was kind of a precursor for that this kind of got the motion Wheels in Motion for getting that done  So I take it and that s what the I think you ve previously for to refer to as there any ants suspicious Carrera monitoring program  You ve already enhanced Som program  Yes  and you would agree with me that that enhanced program was required to meet all the requirements set forth in this letter which you know  Not only what was in this letter  Keep in mind the DEA did not tell us what should be in our program  They never they didn t tell us whether it was correct  They didn t want to see our program  They just told us that these are some of the things that we wanted to see in your program  We did this stuff and including some other things that we thought were important  Okay  so this in other words  this was a floor not a ceiling  correct  But it was it was critically important to Malik Wright that it s enhanced Som program meet at a minimum requirements in this letter  Yes  And so directing your attention to page two  It says registrants that rely on Rigid formula to find whether an order is suspicious maybe failing to detect suspicious orders  For example  A system that identifies orders that suspicious only if the total amount of a controlled substance ordered during one month exceeds the amount ordered the previous month by a certain percentage or more is insufficient  And so What is your understanding of what that requirement is  Well  I think what they re saying is that it shouldn t be based on just what the previous month was was what previous month order might have been  Okay  they re saying is that they want you to take a look at a ongoing what I ll call a floating month period like I described earlier to to you a rolling time period so It wasn t from calendar year  It was like January to January February 22 February so it kept moving depending on so if you re in April  it was looking at orders that were placed from March to March  Okay  Now it also says their the registrants are rely on Rigid formulas to find whether an order is suspicious may be failing to detect suspicious  That s exactly what I m trying to describe to you right there  They re not saying don t look at what they are  Just a previous  Month  look at what they ve done over to previous 12 months or in our case  We said  okay  we re going to look at 12 months for old roving period of time  Okay  Doesn t this also tell you though that of all you re doing is relying on a rigid formula on a numeric formula  That is also insufficient  Yeah  and that s what I m trying to explain to you  Not only did we have this what they re saying otter they say order during one month period exceeds the amount of water  That was rigid  That s what they considered Ridgid  Okay  what they were saying don t rely on what they just ordered the previous month  That s what they consider rigid  So the rolling months was not rigid  Okay  we only when not only did Rolling months  but we went in frequency over a period of time  We not only looked at a particular size and I m of a bulk product  you know  this also applies to the dosage because I m thinking a dosage because we had different sizes of at the same product  We would look at the family  Okay  meaning combining all the products within let s say Hydrocodone  we had several different sizes  So we would look at the bulks of that size  Okay  so if they changed it up and they won from 10 by 5225 by 50  you know  just to we would we would take the entire amount that was being bought and make sure they weren t buying more than what they normally did  And so I think Did more so than what the regulations were requiring  Now directing your attention back to exhibit to do you have that in you put that in front of me  So that yeah that that would be the first d a letter we looked at  Okay  and you say on page 2 it s got under the circumstances that might be indicative of diversion  It s identifying for different issues  Pitch to you said yes  and we re at circumstances that might be indicative of the version  I m sorry  It s actually page 3 of the up the letter  Okay page 3At the top  Okay  you would agree that we re looking at pharmacies  Right  Well  we are looking at circumstances that might be indicative of diversion  Okay  and so you would agree that a adequate suspicious order monitoring program would take into account these four circumstances  What did not Number two  I don t think is something that would involve what we were in the business  Doing ordering a limited variety of controlled substances and quantities disc disproportionate to the quantity of non controlled medications  I well I don t I see how that applies so  I m sorry  It s not something that we would have been looking at  Well isn t what that what that the well we found a requirement  It s one ordering ordering a limited variety of controlled substances and quantity disproportionate to the quantity of non controlled medications worked  So of a distributor was doing that from you mean it is all the well let me rephrase that if a retail pharmacy was only ordering controlled substances from you in quantities disproportionate to the quantity of non controlled medications ordered  So we re talking to retail for To see here  Wouldn t that be something you re suspicious order monitoring program should pick up on when you say non controlled medication orders and that sure and I control medications  What would that be  Well  I assumed it would be other Pharmaceuticals that were not for example scheduled to okay  Again  I go back to this is something that we were not we didn t have the tools to do at that time  Well  but you would agree that this is a circumstance that might be indicative of diversion which you re not I suppose it could be yes and given that and given that this is I mean the DEA is flagging this as a an issue that they are concerned about wouldn t it be important for Mallinckrodt suspicious order monitoring program particularly  its enhanced Som program to take this into account  We weren t as far as pharmacies  We were selling to chain pharmacies and we were shipping too  Through their shipping sites  not particular pharmacies  Okay  not individual pharmacies  We re selling to their warehouses  But if a chain of a chain pharmacy is only ordering scheduled two substances substances from you  isn t that something that your program ought to have taken into account and registered  If we had the resources to do so I suppose so  And just as a time change in about an hour since the last week sure actually what why don t I finish up on exhibit for and then then we can take a quick break  So page 2 of exhibit for that s a 2007 D a letter page  Okay page 2 of 4  Yes  This is lastly registrants that routinely report suspicious orders yet fill these orders without first determining that order is not being diverted into other than legitimate medical scientific and Industrial  Maybe failing to maintain effective controls against the version now I get to use them Mallinckrodt terminology  I should be substituting in Peculiar orders  Is that fair  Correct  Okay  so registrants that routine or you know registrants that routinely report peculiar orders yet fill those orders without first determining that order is not being diverted into other than legitimate scientific and Industrial channels may be failing to maintain effective controls against diversion  You would agree with that statement  Yes  okay  So as part of Mallinckrodt suspicious order monitoring program  Yes  it had to make sure that it did not report  It did not identify peculiar orders and yet fill those orders without first determining that the order was not being diverted  Is that correct  You talking about and at this time period are you talking during when well we talking about bulk  Are we talking about  Well  let s let s focus on dosage products  Okay after do such products right prior to 2007 it would have been improper for Mallinckrodt to identify a peculiar order and fill that order without first determining that the order was not being diverted into other than legitimate medical scientific and Industrial channels that Yes  okay and presumably in the post 2007 time period under your enhanced suspicious monitoring program  It still would have been improper to fill an order without first investigating the orders that correct the form keep in mind like I ve mentioned before prior to 2007  We were we were instructed by our field offices at that time our DEA feels offices that the monthly Port that we gave them was sufficient  Okay  but nevertheless from a from a standpoint from a as far as I can only speak towards bog because at that s what I had at the time  Okay  So besides the program that we had in place which was what the DEA required at that time regardless of what this letter is saying we were So modern tearing our our our customers of any orders that we felt our csrs would Notify myself are caring Harper that hey we ve got an order that s more so more than what the car customer normally buys and we would we identify that and turn it over to Karen Harper for her to discuss with the DEA  I want to keep in mind that in the bulk  The area in a timeframe of seven days to a month would be our normal period of filling in order because we manufactured all the ours make on order  Okay  We didn t stock bulk narcotics  We didn t have the the inventory to be able to stock it  So everything was made to order and the timeframe that we needed  Our was anywhere from seven days  I do  A month  Okay  So we had one I m getting as we had plenty of time prior to the art of Being ship to determine determine whether it was suspicious auger or not  Okay  but as I as I understand this letter to be stating and please correct me  If you have a different interpretation what it s saying is that if you identify a peculiar order  you should not ship that order without investigating whether the order is whether the order is being diverted  Is that accurate  Oh  it s say so okay  Yeah  so With respect to both bulk and dosage products and with respect to both pre 2007 and post 2007  It would have been improper for Mallinckrodt to ship an order without first concluding an investigation well strike that it would have been improper for Mallinckrodt to ship a peculiar order without first concluding its investigation as to whether that order was not going to be diverted  Is that accurate object to the form  I would say When I had dosage at the time that the we had an agreement with Karen Harper that we didn t always have the the time because otters would go out on a daily basis from when they were they were entered and they would kick if it went order kicked out his peculiar  We didn t always have the ability to do the thorough  Even prior to the otter being shipped  Okay  and we came to that conclusion after several months of orders being placed through our system and we did not have any suspicious otters what we had any suspicious orders for so we felt comfortable that we could go ahead and ship the otter and the reason why we were not able to always thoroughly investigate the otter  Prior to its shipping was one we didn t have the information available from the CSR our first Contact  Okay  They didn t know why this is order was being placed for unusual order was being placed  Secondly we go to the business manager for that product if they had business manager didn t know why there was an unusual are being placed  We would then go to the salesperson this all took time because these people are always available To get back to us  Okay  and we felt comfortable enough through our through this program being in place for several months before we went to that that we could continue to invest that investigate that otter because that otter was going to a distributor who also had a program in place for suspicious otters  So we knew we had we could get the product back or stop it if need be so in certain circumstances then Mallinckrodt would ship peculiar orders without Completing its investigation as to whether that order might be diverted into other than legitimate medical scientific or industrial channels  Is that correct rejection of Vegas the time go ahead  Yes  we honor are circumstances where we didn t want to hold up the otter because of people needing for for the legitimate reasons medical needs  We didn t want to hold up the otter but we continue to go through the process of identifying whether it was legitimate or not  and I can say that from the time the time period that I have it we did not have the suspicious otter did you ever inform the a that you were doing this  Yes  Well  let me say we informed Rd compliance person caring Harper and she was an agreement to that  But did you ever form The Drug Enforcement Administration  I did not talk to the drug enforcement agency in myself  Do you know if Karen Harper informed that there  I don t know what Karen Harper did so you have no basis to believe that the DEA felt that this was an acceptable practice  I would say as well as I know Karen Harper and how she dealt with the DEA  She kept them informed of what we were doing  She would not she would not doing anything without their blessing did Karen Harper ever tell you that the DEA had signed off on this agreement  No  And when you say that you had an agreement with Karen Harper  What what do you mean by that  I asked her based upon the circumstances that I described if it was okay to do this and she agreed to it and what this agreement memorialized in writing  I believe there was an email was was this agreement memorialized in any formal policy put out by Mallinckrodt  Not that I m aware of  So this agreement that would not be included in whatever written policy you had regarding your enhanced suspicious order monitoring program what it I don t remember  Okay  we do you want to take a break now Rocky  Let s take a break  Okay ,0.84700368307359308,Nov 16  2018 11 04 30AM Nov 16  2018 11 31 58AM Nov 16  2018 11 32 53AM

Söhne,McDonald's",We re back on the record at 10 21 a semester Roush  You indicated that in 2008 you and Kathy Stewart essentially switched jobs  So you went to dosage products and she went to bulk narcotics  That s correct  Why did you switch  Our boss of time George tafel wanted us to switch to learn more about the other areas  And the other area is meaning he wanted you to learn more about dosage products and her to learn more about that s all correct products  right  Did George have any concerns about Kathy s stewardship of the dosage products  Yeah  And would you view your your switch in 2008 as a promotion for you know  it was a lateral  Now  do we call our prior discussion regarding the quota system  Yes  and so I want to focus now on bulk narcotics with respect to the quota system  Well  I guess what why are quotas important  Quotas are important and I again I m speaking as a customer service person  I m not you know privy to all the the regulations that like Aaron Harper into compliance group would would be but from what I remember the quota system was important in for the DEA to keep track of what was being  Use in the United States  So like I mentioned earlier the da would take all the quota all the all the quota  Letters and forms and 2222 Farms that were perused and I m not only talking  you know from the Distributors  but also from the the pharmacist and everyone else that had to report to the DA what they were using during the year  They would take that add it all up and see what the total was for United States for a particular  Product and they would use that for their base for what they were going to allow the following year  So that s why the reporting through the quota system was very very important  And you had indicated that the the compliance with the quota system was an element of Mallinckrodt efforts to fight diversion  Is that fair  Well  I wouldn t say it was that you know  it was to meet the regulations that were given to us by the DEA as as a good citizen Malachi being a good citizen  We felt it was very important that we follow the regulations in that to keep something like diversion happening  And so what are what are all of the steps focusing now on the bulk narcotics  Side  what are all the steps that Mallinckrodt took to ensure that the quota system was being complied with we would we would require from our customers along with their order to send us a quart of warm under their license  whether they re a manufacturer or a researcher or whatever license  They had they had to send us a quote a farm and we would not use we could not ship that otter until that farm was sent to us and what we would do with with the quota Farms then turn that into our compliance group  And did the did the quota form indicate their overall quota for the year No  usually it was the amount that they were ordering  It couldn t be more than what was on the otter  And so how how would Mallinckrodt know that this order that the order that the newest ordered  Your customer had submitted didn t exceed their quota for the year  It would show the total  I believe if I m not and I m trying to remember I think it would show the total but then it would also show what they were using for that particular order and when you say total  I m sorry  What total are you referring to  You were asking what how we knew what the customers final was  My apologies  Let me rephrase that question  The quota form would show the total amount of that narcotic  They had received that year that they were ordering from us  Okay understood  but I guess my question may be a little different  So let s say the da gives manufacturer a a quota of 100 kg and Mallinckrodt and they submit an order to Mallinckrodt asking to purchase three kilograms  Okay  How does Mallinckrodt know  But whether that 3 Kg order is going to exceed their hundred kilogram quota  It would show the total and then what had been used so far  So the quote of what I remember  So your recollection is that the quota form is going to show their overall quota  So 100 kg plus the amount that they had ordered up  So the total amount they had ordered thus far for the year  I believe so from what I remember and was that just orders from Mallinckrodt was that all orders be all orders  So if Manufacturer a were ordering  you know bulk product from Mallinckrodt and three other manufacturers the quota form is going to show the total amount  They had received from all of those other manufacturers  And did Mallinckrodt take any steps to ensure that those numbers were for accurate  Customer service was a responsible for that so we would turn into forms to our compliance group  So that would be for them to determine that they reported through their system  which was Darko system  which I m not that familiar with but that s how they reported what the manufacturer are our customers add taken  From us or sold to them from us  And our kids would tell you how much our crews would give you the amount of product that the manufacturer had obtained from Mallinckrodt  Would it also provide you with the information as to how much they had obtained from everyone else  I would have to refer you to Karen Harper on that  And going over to the dosage side  What was the system in place on the dosage side to ensure that the quota system was being complied with  The customer had to give us a 22 to form that match the order quantity that they are ordering and that to to farm would then sent be sent to our compliance person and they would gather all that those compliance Farms  I believe on a monthly basis and send them to the DEA  But then again  that s the compliance group and I would refer you to them for more information and did the 22 to form also contain the total quota assigned to that if it did but I remember it was just for that particular order  So I guess going back to my question from the bulk side with respect to the dosage side of the business  How did Mallinckrodt know that well strike  That so let s take the following hypothetical distributor a has a quota from the a for 100 pills  It s a Mitzvah to to to form to Mallinckrodt asking to buy 10 pills  How does Mallinckrodt know that those ten pills don t exceed the hundred pill quota  We probably wouldn t but remember that the DEA is issuing the 22 to farm  So they as we turn in our we and whoever else they re buying from the 222 Farms back to the DEA the DEA would give them new to to Farms based upon  On what was left And you know how DEA set the quotas  No  that would be like Aaron Harper question  But you would agree that it s very important to comply with that quota system  Oh  yes So we previously spoke about diversion and you recall that yes  and is it your understanding that Mallinckrodt products were being diverted  Is it my understanding  Not that I m aware of  I ve just from what I guess from  I heard from the news  Well  but you ve seen news reports indicating that Mallinckrodt products have been diverted that there  Yes  And you recall what those news reports said  No  not really  But your understanding from these news reports is that Mallinckrodt products were being diverted and they were being abused  Is that fair  correct  Are you familiar with the term Ms  Ms  Ms  No  I m not  What about Molly s Molly s I ve heard of them  but I don t know specifically what they are  Are you familiar  Are you familiar with any terms or any references to mallik Road products with respect to being street drugs  No  So given that Mallinckrodt products were being diverted and they were being abused  Are there any additional steps looking back in hindsight that you feel Mallinckrodt should have taken well  just want to Say that if you if you remember where we were in the chain of a manufacturing if we re talking about balke at this time  where we talking about 2007 are we talking generic  Well  let s time frame  Let s start with dosage products and then we can go to okay  Okay  keep in mind that the generic business we were  you know  we had our own regulations in place of meeting the The requirements plus we develop our suspicious are monitoring program  which was another step of identifying orders that may have been out of order or suspicious quantities  And when we sold those sold our product they went to Distributors who were supposed to have their own suspicious are monitoring programs and Place and then they sold to druggist and then too Physicians and then to the end user  So there is a quite a number of people in between Mallinckrodt and the end user  So I would say that we did our due diligence in trying to keep the version from happening  And when you say due diligence  what do you mean by that bye bye meeting the requirements  of the DEAAnd so it was very important to you that Mallinckrodt meet these da requirements  I d say it s probably the most important thing that we did  And this view was widely shared at the company  It s a grass it was  I will add that when we were developing our suspicious our program that that was rolled out to our marketing people and also our sales force on what our requirements were and what their part would be going forward in helping us on on controlling any any possible suspicious otters are Tires as we became became known as later on  How did you know that you re suspicious order monitoring program was effective  We did not have one suspicious otter  While I was doing the job and when you say you did not have one suspicious order while you were doing the job  What do you mean by that  Well  just to talk about a little bit about the suspicious art of program that we develop in order would be flagged every day an order could be flagged on a daily basis as being suspicious  Our peculiar as we called it and what that is is just a stage that we went through if an artery was flagged as being peculiar  It was during my time my my job or responsibility to talk to marketing are our customer service reps who would be the first people that I would talk to because they were in tune to our customers and what their order needs were and they would know if there was anything unusual as are as a distributor picking up a new customer that they had and had before that they would now need increased material to supply and if our CSR did not have a answer to why the customer was ordering more I would go to the product manager our business manager whatever they were being called at the time who is had that particular product that the order was far and I would ask them if they knew why all of a sudden we were having a peculiar art from that at customer and A peculiar odor again would be unusual quantity from what they have bought in the past over a period of time based upon the logarithms that we set in place in our computer system  If they didn t know am I Next Step would be going to the salesperson and asking them  And so when you say that you didn t have any suspicious orders though  Well  what do you mean  What do you mean by that suspicious are is one that would be where there is  Possible where we could not identify for whatever reason what reason the customer was ordering more than what they had in the past that would become a suspicious order and we report that to care and Harper and her group who would then reported to the DEA  And so and I just want to try to understand what your testimony is  Are you saying that because none of your customers ever submitted a suspicious ordered to you that you re suspicious order monitoring program was effective  I m saying that during the time that I was running the program and working the program that we did not have a suspicious otter  And when you say you did not have a suspicious order that means that you didn t identify any orders that were suspicious  We identified ours or peculiar  but we could explain them and then that go to the point of being a suspicious order and I guess my question is and you ve indicated that you could explain all of your peculiar orders  How do you know that that your explanations were in fact  correct because in identifying the why the order was being Determine the game peculiar  We had an elf a legitimate explanation of why the otter was larger or peculiar from what it had been in the past increase sales a new customer was coming aboard that the customer of ours had gotten they were explainable orders is what I m saying  So therefore they went to Peculiar to Play Jim a daughter  And the explanation you are getting though was ultimately being provided by the customers that accurate  by the by the swell from the salesman are from marketing are to product manager in dealing with the customer  So they would get the information from the customer and really it to you at that  Yes  Was there ever a circumstance where a customer lied to one of your sales reps  I don t know that  If the customer lied to your sales rep than in fact  the the order would not be legitimate  Is that correct  that s possible  but what I m saying that from when I was working at We were we were satisfied with explanations that we were receiving from our sales force and the marketing Folks at why the order was legitimate  Are you familiar with the compensation scheme for your Salesforce  No  I m not  Do you know if they re bonus was dependent in any way on the number of sales they made well  I would guess it s sales would be involved but keep in mind that the sales force were very aware of the DEA compliance that Mallinckrodt enforced and they knew it could lead to firing our us losing our license to manufacturing cell  So Is a high priority for us over and Beyond sales  What s the Salesforce is compensation based upon their complete strike that  Was a salesforce s compensation in any way based upon their compliance with the DEA regulations  I can t I can t answer that  I don t know  So I d like to mark this as exhibit one  Sartre and Let me give a copy you Rocky go actually  here s there s another one for the team  And actually this this exhibit one is goes in connection with exhibit to so I m going to mark that as well Mr  Rauch  I ve handed you to exhibits  The first one is an email chain  And it Bears the Bates number M  NK T 127 3559  That s exhibit 1  And then I ve also provided you with an exhibit marked exhibit to this is a letter from the DEA and it s dated September 27 2006 and it Bears the Bates number M and K T 127 3563  Okay  Do you have both exhibit sir  I do okay  and so directing your attention to the email at the very top of the email chain answer  Which what exhibit one on exhibit 1  Okay  Do you see the second paragraph  That s hurts  Please note the Vince came in and I had a conversation  Yes  okay  And this is an email from Karen Harper  but she s indicating that she shared a DEA letter with you  Do you see that  Correct  Okay and exhibit to I believe is that letter which one can look at that  Yes  Could you look at that  Okay  Do you recall Karen Harper sharing this letter from you with you  I don t okay  just because I don t remember saying it s been a long time  But do you recall receiving this letter at some point  I don t recall it  but that doesn t mean I didn t receive it  Okay Do you recall ever reviewing a letter like this  Yes  And why did you review this letter  Can I take a look at it  Yes  It s actually why don t you review that letter and let me know when you re ready  Okay Okay  So directing your attention to the second page of this letter I Bears the bait summer 2735 64 you see the third paragraph from the bottom starts with us in addition  Okay  and can you read that paragraph into the record for me thus in addition to reporting all suspicious otters a distributor has a statutory responsibility to exercise due diligence to avoid filling suspicious ours that might be diverted into other legitimate medical scientific and Industrial channels failure to exercise such due diligence could as circumstances warrant provide a statutory statutory basis for Revocation or suspension of the Distributors registration now  did you understand that that legal requirement also applied to Mallinckrodt as a manufacturer check to the floor  Yes  and then do you see in the the paragraph beneath that it says a distributor may not simply rely on the fact that the person placing the suspicious order is a DEA registrant and turn a blind eye to the suspicious circumstances  Do you understand that 20c required also apply to Mallinckrodt as a manufacturer  Yes  then turning to page 3 of the memo and two circumstances that might be indicative of diversion in identify for poor circumstances  Would you agree that those circumstances are ones that are indicative of diversion  Certain pharmacies have engaged in this passing controls  Those are for circumstances that could lead to Diversion  Yes  and so if a distributor of a Distributors order fell within one of these four circumstances You would agree that that is potentially a suspicious order would you not  We kill your daughter  Yes  Then below that there s a there s a paragraph below that with 10 questions  Do you see that  Yes  So the first question is what percentage of the pharmacies business does dispensing Controlled Substances constitute  Would you agree that that is important information to to have and evaluating whether an order is suspicious for the distributor  Yes  I would say yes  and then if you were to change this question  so that would be what percentage of the distributor s business dispensing Controlled Substances constitute  Would you agree that that s important information for Mallinckrodt to have with respect to its customer  Yes  And so for number 2  It says it s a pharmacy complying with the laws of every state in which it is dispensing Controlled Substances  If you were to substitute  you know  one of my lacrosse customers and for pharmacy  would you agree that s important information for Mallinckrodt to have yes  So looking at these  I guess the remaining 10 questions and an effort to try to truncate things  Would you agree that all of these questions as apply to Malik rats customers are important information for Mallinckrodt to have in assessing whether an order is peculiar  back to the Forum No  not all of them would apply to our business of selling to Distributors  which ones would not apply  Well does the pharmacy fill prescriptions issued by practitioners  Based solely on an online questionnaire  Without a medical exam or Bonafide doctor patient relationship  Do you want me to go through all of them and tell you which ones I don t think what apply  Yes  I think that d be helpful  So I have number 5 and then number threenumber four Number yeah  number 8 is something that we wouldn t when be part of number 9 number 10 and your basis for identifying these is because Mallinckrodt doesn t do business directly with pharmacies  is that correct  That s correct  Okay does malloc Rock do business with with retail pharmacies though  For example  you know CVS or Walgreens with chains with Pharmacy chains  right  And so if a pharmacy chain fell into any one of these six categories with when that be of concern to Mallinckrodt object to the formI would guess so so for example if you had a retail pharmacy that was soliciting buyers of Controlled Substances via the Internet or is a pharmacy associated with the internet that s less its orders for controlled substances  That would be of concern to Malik Rock  What a not  Yes  okay  And modifying that question  If you were if one of your Distributors was doing business with for example a pharmacy or an Internet site affiliated with the pharmacy offering to facilitate the acquisition of a prescription for a controlled substance from a practitioner with whom the buyer has no pre existing relationship  Wouldn t that be of concern to you  We sold to Distributors not to your question was about the distributor  Well  no  I m sorry  Let me rephrase that  My question is now about the distributor s customers  Okay  so you ve got a list here of 10 essentially  Would it be fair to call these red flags  Yes  Okay  So you ve got a question  You ve got a list here of 10 red flags if he distributor is doing business with a pharmacy that raises one or more red flags  Wouldn t that be of concern  Mallinckrodt jump to the Forum  Well  it would be a red flag for the distributor who also has a suspicious are monitoring program  That should be in place  Okay  We were we were not monitoring our customers customer at this time  We were asked to to monitor  Our customers are build a report suspicious our program on our customers  You said you re not monitoring them at this time  Well  okay  we weren t monitoring them what I when I had this back in 2007 when I was in our 2006 actually when I didn t I was in the bulk area not in the dosage area  but our program was based upon the customers that we were selling to  Not who the customers customers were selling to we didn t have that information available to us at that time  And you know if I make myself clear  well  I think so  but I want to make sure that I okay what you re saying  So with respect to the bulk area  which is prior to 2006 which is prior to 2007  This letter is dated 2006  You re saying that from from the standpoint of the bulk narcotics business  Yes  You were not looking at your customers customer  That s that s correct  And keep in mind back then  We were sending a monthly letter to the DA office  Which I think I buy talked about earlier and in our conversation that was a requirement of the DEA at that time in 2006 and I believe into 2007 and then the da was telling us through our compliance group is where we were getting the information like this and then in talks with her that the letter was no longer needed  They didn t want to see the letter  They wanted us to start developing a program which we would call our ongoing are suspicious our monitoring program  which we worked on for a period of time and was put in place in the end of 2008  Well from the Paulk the bulk business  We were monitoring our customers not their customers  But Mallinckrodt had the capability of monitoring your customers customers did not On the bulk business  No  not that I am aware of did it have the ability to do so on the dosage side  From a customer service perspective  No  Well  you indicated a customer service perspective  I guess I would ask we did not have the resources to identify who our customer who our customer were selling to and when you say resources you re talking about you didn t have enough employees  you know  No we did not have the data information available to us that I m aware of  On the either on the dosage side or on the bulk side  Well  are we bouncing back and forth well on the box  I we certainly did not okay  So on the bolt side  you did not have you do not have the data that would allow you to know who your customers customer was Rocky now turning to the dosage side  which I did not have at that time  Understood but turning to the dosage side prior to 2007 right  Did Mal are you aware  Well  it s right that did Mallinckrodt have the ability to monitor its customers customer  I was not aware if it was or not  And when you say you re not aware you is that is strike that you don t know one way or the other  Is that fair  correct  What Kathy Stewart  No  Jeff to the floor  I can t answer that  I don t know what Kathy would know about it  But in any event Mallinckrodt was not monitoring its customers customer on the dosage side prior to 2007  As far as I know they were not they were they were doing the same thing  The bulk side was do doing would you agree though that from a standpoint of diversion control and diversion prevention  It would be helpful to know your customers customer  I can t answer that  I don t I don t know the answer to that from a diversion  I mean I keep in mind I want to reiterate that  We were not the only player in this this closed loop where we were selling to our customer  Our customer was supposed to be monitoring their customer all the way down to the pharmacist and the doctor  Well  but I have a slightly different question which is you know  a distributor is Distributing to let s say internet pharmacies that are just for filling prescriptions  you know over the Internet  It s a soliciting orders over than internet and that is a an area of concern  That s one of the red flags raised in this 2006 letters and not yes  Okay  So you ve got a distributor and you know that distributor is doing business with those types of pharmacies isn t that of Mallinckrodt I think that s one of the reasons we put in our program on the deviation of otters that were coming from our customers to show if there was a suspicious order there  We couldn t tell who they were selling to at that time  If you re if you re asking me that I think do I feel that knowing our customers customer  Would benefit Malin crowd or benefit the diversion that s possible  I bet I can answer that for for sure  Well if Mallinckrodt though had the ability to monitor its customers customer  That was that hypothetically  Hypothetically if they had the ability to do that  Would you agree that it would have been helpful to Diversion control for them to do so that s right to the floor  Yes  it would be helpful  Do you believe it should have been required  I can answer that we were meeting the requirements that I felt were in place at the time  That s a that s a Karen Harper question  So turning now  I m going to focus your attention on two other two more exhibits  And so I m marking these in tandem as exhibit 3 and Exhibits for I m sorry  this is exhibit 3 and it Bears the Bates number M and Katie 14 1987 for and while I m labeling things I m going to post a label exhibit for this is a key a letter and if there s the Bates number M and Katie 1421 084Okay  you want me to read this so you won t fit so actually I just have a few quick questions on this cover email  Okay  but it is an email to from Kevin Harper to Kathy Stewart  Do you see the second email that stated the second email from the top date of March 12 2008  Okay  Yes  I d references attached information that Karen had sent to you and Michael Feeny who is Michael Finney  Michael Feeney was my boss at the time  And believe the attachments on the attachment to this email  Is this December 27 2007 letter  So if I could well  do you recall Karen Harper sending you this this letter  No  I don t  Okay  Actually  I m sorry if you look at the very bottom of the page  there s an email from Karen Harper dated January 4 2008 and you are you re one of the CCS  You see that  Yes  Okay  Do you recall Karen Harper sending you this email  No  it s been do you have any reason to doubt that she sent you this even though I don t okay  and could you please review the December 27 2007 letter believe that s exhibit for Okay  Okay  So do you recall reviewing this letter when you were employed by Mallinckrodt  I recall it  Okay  so directing your attention to the third paragraph from the top of the first page of the letter  Okay  So the regulation also requires that the registrant inform the local DEA Division office of suspicious orders when discovered by the registrar Okay  filing a monthly report of completed transactions EG an excessive purchase report or high unit purchases does not meet the regulatory requirement to report suspicious orders registrants are reminded that the responsibility does not end merely with the filled with the filing of a suspicious order report  Registrants must conduct an independent analysis of suspicious orders prior to completing a sale to determine whether the controlled substances are likely to be diverted from legitimate channels  Do you understand that language  Yes  And is that is that a correct statement of Mallinckrodt responsibilities under the law  Yes  okay  Further on down at State s regulation specifically states that suspicious orders include orders of an unusual size orders deviating substantially from a normal pattern and Orders of an unusual frequency these criteria are disjunctive and not all and are not all inclusive  Do you see that  Yes  and you understand what that means  Yes  and is that an accurate statement of what a suspicious order is Yes  And then some okay at the very bottom of that paragraph  It says the size of an order alone  whether it whether or not it deviates from a normal pattern is enough to trigger the registrants responsibility to report the order as suspicious  The determination of whether an order is suspicious depends not only on the ordering patterns of the particular customer  but also on the patterns of the registrants customer base and the patterns throughout the relevant segments of the regulated industry  Do you see that statement  I do and you agree with it  Yes  and so you understood this to be a accurate statement of Mallinckrodt legal responsibilities with respect to suspicious orders from the bulk side  which is where I was at this time  This was where we started from  What I remember the our St  Louis field office did not want to receive the monthly report any longer  Okay  and We were instructed caring Harper and Michael Feeney and some other folks put together a team of people to come up with a more robust suspicious otter monitoring program  which included myself Kathy Karen Harper oversaw  but she didn t need come to all the meetings  We had a few  Kuwaiti people that which involved to come up with a more robust authoring suspicious order monitoring program that would identify otters as being peculiar as the orders came through this was developed over time period of like 2000 and In the 2000 2008 time period and put in place and this I guess you would call us  This was kind of a precursor for that this kind of got the motion Wheels in Motion for getting that done  So I take it and that s what the I think you ve previously for to refer to as there any ants suspicious Carrera monitoring program  You ve already enhanced Som program  Yes  and you would agree with me that that enhanced program was required to meet all the requirements set forth in this letter which you know  Not only what was in this letter  Keep in mind the DEA did not tell us what should be in our program  They never they didn t tell us whether it was correct  They didn t want to see our program  They just told us that these are some of the things that we wanted to see in your program  We did this stuff and including some other things that we thought were important  Okay  so this in other words  this was a floor not a ceiling  correct  But it was it was critically important to Malik Wright that it s enhanced Som program meet at a minimum requirements in this letter  Yes  And so directing your attention to page two  It says registrants that rely on Rigid formula to find whether an order is suspicious maybe failing to detect suspicious orders  For example  A system that identifies orders that suspicious only if the total amount of a controlled substance ordered during one month exceeds the amount ordered the previous month by a certain percentage or more is insufficient  And so What is your understanding of what that requirement is  Well  I think what they re saying is that it shouldn t be based on just what the previous month was was what previous month order might have been  Okay  they re saying is that they want you to take a look at a ongoing what I ll call a floating month period like I described earlier to to you a rolling time period so It wasn t from calendar year  It was like January to January February 22 February so it kept moving depending on so if you re in April  it was looking at orders that were placed from March to March  Okay  Now it also says their the registrants are rely on Rigid formulas to find whether an order is suspicious may be failing to detect suspicious  That s exactly what I m trying to describe to you right there  They re not saying don t look at what they are  Just a previous  Month  look at what they ve done over to previous 12 months or in our case  We said  okay  we re going to look at 12 months for old roving period of time  Okay  Doesn t this also tell you though that of all you re doing is relying on a rigid formula on a numeric formula  That is also insufficient  Yeah  and that s what I m trying to explain to you  Not only did we have this what they re saying otter they say order during one month period exceeds the amount of water  That was rigid  That s what they considered Ridgid  Okay  what they were saying don t rely on what they just ordered the previous month  That s what they consider rigid  So the rolling months was not rigid  Okay  we only when not only did Rolling months  but we went in frequency over a period of time  We not only looked at a particular size and I m of a bulk product  you know  this also applies to the dosage because I m thinking a dosage because we had different sizes of at the same product  We would look at the family  Okay  meaning combining all the products within let s say Hydrocodone  we had several different sizes  So we would look at the bulks of that size  Okay  so if they changed it up and they won from 10 by 5225 by 50  you know  just to we would we would take the entire amount that was being bought and make sure they weren t buying more than what they normally did  And so I think Did more so than what the regulations were requiring  Now directing your attention back to exhibit to do you have that in you put that in front of me  So that yeah that that would be the first d a letter we looked at  Okay  and you say on page 2 it s got under the circumstances that might be indicative of diversion  It s identifying for different issues  Pitch to you said yes  and we re at circumstances that might be indicative of the version  I m sorry  It s actually page 3 of the up the letter  Okay page 3At the top  Okay  you would agree that we re looking at pharmacies  Right  Well  we are looking at circumstances that might be indicative of diversion  Okay  and so you would agree that a adequate suspicious order monitoring program would take into account these four circumstances  What did not Number two  I don t think is something that would involve what we were in the business  Doing ordering a limited variety of controlled substances and quantities disc disproportionate to the quantity of non controlled medications  I well I don t I see how that applies so  I m sorry  It s not something that we would have been looking at  Well isn t what that what that the well we found a requirement  It s one ordering ordering a limited variety of controlled substances and quantity disproportionate to the quantity of non controlled medications worked  So of a distributor was doing that from you mean it is all the well let me rephrase that if a retail pharmacy was only ordering controlled substances from you in quantities disproportionate to the quantity of non controlled medications ordered  So we re talking to retail for To see here  Wouldn t that be something you re suspicious order monitoring program should pick up on when you say non controlled medication orders and that sure and I control medications  What would that be  Well  I assumed it would be other Pharmaceuticals that were not for example scheduled to okay  Again  I go back to this is something that we were not we didn t have the tools to do at that time  Well  but you would agree that this is a circumstance that might be indicative of diversion which you re not I suppose it could be yes and given that and given that this is I mean the DEA is flagging this as a an issue that they are concerned about wouldn t it be important for Mallinckrodt suspicious order monitoring program particularly  its enhanced Som program to take this into account  We weren t as far as pharmacies  We were selling to chain pharmacies and we were shipping too  Through their shipping sites  not particular pharmacies  Okay  not individual pharmacies  We re selling to their warehouses  But if a chain of a chain pharmacy is only ordering scheduled two substances substances from you  isn t that something that your program ought to have taken into account and registered  If we had the resources to do so I suppose so  And just as a time change in about an hour since the last week sure actually what why don t I finish up on exhibit for and then then we can take a quick break  So page 2 of exhibit for that s a 2007 D a letter page  Okay page 2 of 4  Yes  This is lastly registrants that routinely report suspicious orders yet fill these orders without first determining that order is not being diverted into other than legitimate medical scientific and Industrial  Maybe failing to maintain effective controls against the version now I get to use them Mallinckrodt terminology  I should be substituting in Peculiar orders  Is that fair  Correct  Okay  so registrants that routine or you know registrants that routinely report peculiar orders yet fill those orders without first determining that order is not being diverted into other than legitimate scientific and Industrial channels may be failing to maintain effective controls against diversion  You would agree with that statement  Yes  okay  So as part of Mallinckrodt suspicious order monitoring program  Yes  it had to make sure that it did not report  It did not identify peculiar orders and yet fill those orders without first determining that the order was not being diverted  Is that correct  You talking about and at this time period are you talking during when well we talking about bulk  Are we talking about  Well  let s let s focus on dosage products  Okay after do such products right prior to 2007 it would have been improper for Mallinckrodt to identify a peculiar order and fill that order without first determining that the order was not being diverted into other than legitimate medical scientific and Industrial channels that Yes  okay and presumably in the post 2007 time period under your enhanced suspicious monitoring program  It still would have been improper to fill an order without first investigating the orders that correct the form keep in mind like I ve mentioned before prior to 2007  We were we were instructed by our field offices at that time our DEA feels offices that the monthly Port that we gave them was sufficient  Okay  but nevertheless from a from a standpoint from a as far as I can only speak towards bog because at that s what I had at the time  Okay  So besides the program that we had in place which was what the DEA required at that time regardless of what this letter is saying we were So modern tearing our our our customers of any orders that we felt our csrs would Notify myself are caring Harper that hey we ve got an order that s more so more than what the car customer normally buys and we would we identify that and turn it over to Karen Harper for her to discuss with the DEA  I want to keep in mind that in the bulk  The area in a timeframe of seven days to a month would be our normal period of filling in order because we manufactured all the ours make on order  Okay  We didn t stock bulk narcotics  We didn t have the the inventory to be able to stock it  So everything was made to order and the timeframe that we needed  Our was anywhere from seven days  I do  A month  Okay  So we had one I m getting as we had plenty of time prior to the art of Being ship to determine determine whether it was suspicious auger or not  Okay  but as I as I understand this letter to be stating and please correct me  If you have a different interpretation what it s saying is that if you identify a peculiar order  you should not ship that order without investigating whether the order is whether the order is being diverted  Is that accurate  Oh  it s say so okay  Yeah  so With respect to both bulk and dosage products and with respect to both pre 2007 and post 2007  It would have been improper for Mallinckrodt to ship an order without first concluding an investigation well strike that it would have been improper for Mallinckrodt to ship a peculiar order without first concluding its investigation as to whether that order was not going to be diverted  Is that accurate object to the form  I would say When I had dosage at the time that the we had an agreement with Karen Harper that we didn t always have the the time because otters would go out on a daily basis from when they were they were entered and they would kick if it went order kicked out his peculiar  We didn t always have the ability to do the thorough  Even prior to the otter being shipped  Okay  and we came to that conclusion after several months of orders being placed through our system and we did not have any suspicious otters what we had any suspicious orders for so we felt comfortable that we could go ahead and ship the otter and the reason why we were not able to always thoroughly investigate the otter  Prior to its shipping was one we didn t have the information available from the CSR our first Contact  Okay  They didn t know why this is order was being placed for unusual order was being placed  Secondly we go to the business manager for that product if they had business manager didn t know why there was an unusual are being placed  We would then go to the salesperson this all took time because these people are always available To get back to us  Okay  and we felt comfortable enough through our through this program being in place for several months before we went to that that we could continue to invest that investigate that otter because that otter was going to a distributor who also had a program in place for suspicious otters  So we knew we had we could get the product back or stop it if need be so in certain circumstances then Mallinckrodt would ship peculiar orders without Completing its investigation as to whether that order might be diverted into other than legitimate medical scientific or industrial channels  Is that correct rejection of Vegas the time go ahead  Yes  we honor are circumstances where we didn t want to hold up the otter because of people needing for for the legitimate reasons medical needs  We didn t want to hold up the otter but we continue to go through the process of identifying whether it was legitimate or not  and I can say that from the time the time period that I have it we did not have the suspicious otter did you ever inform the a that you were doing this  Yes  Well  let me say we informed Rd compliance person caring Harper and she was an agreement to that  But did you ever form The Drug Enforcement Administration  I did not talk to the drug enforcement agency in myself  Do you know if Karen Harper informed that there  I don t know what Karen Harper did so you have no basis to believe that the DEA felt that this was an acceptable practice  I would say as well as I know Karen Harper and how she dealt with the DEA  She kept them informed of what we were doing  She would not she would not doing anything without their blessing did Karen Harper ever tell you that the DEA had signed off on this agreement  No  And when you say that you had an agreement with Karen Harper  What what do you mean by that  I asked her based upon the circumstances that I described if it was okay to do this and she agreed to it and what this agreement memorialized in writing  I believe there was an email was was this agreement memorialized in any formal policy put out by Mallinckrodt  Not that I m aware of  So this agreement that would not be included in whatever written policy you had regarding your enhanced suspicious order monitoring program what it I don t remember  Okay  we do you want to take a break now Rocky  Let s take a break  Okay

2070 a letter  Do you have that in front of me  Yes  So looking on the back page on the top paragraph and we discussed this briefly during the last session  Okay  you see the top paragraph where it says registrants that rely on Rigid formulas to define whether an order of suspicious may be failing to detect suspicious orders  Yes and your interpretation of that requirement  Is that you couldn t just rely on the month before is that accurate  Well  I think that s what they re saying here  For example A system that identifies otters and suspicious only if the total amount of control 7s are during one month exceeds the amount order to previous month  Okay  and so I thought you know that I interpret as being rigid  And so it would be improper to just look at one month  But if you were to look at the past two months  that would be okay  Is that your interpretation  No  no  Okay  Well what I m saying is what we what we did is we looked at a 12 month  Roving period of time as I explained earlier where we not only looked at the previous month and the month before that and six months before that  but I years basis  so if they placed an order for example in April  okay  what we looked at were otters it had been placed from say March of that year the month before through  The past March of the previous year and so and that then that just kept changing if daughter was placed in may we look from April to April  Does that make sense  I believe I understand that I okay question is so your your your understanding of what it means not to rely on a rigid  Formula is that your formula shouldn t be time limited essentially in one month  Is that so what I think that s what might our interpretations was what the da is saying there  Don t just look at one what they bought the previous month because that s not going to give you a good feel for Our a order pattern that is deviant from possibly past otters and what it what is your basis for that interpretation  Just thought that was the better approach than just looking at one month and from Reading here  It says okay should not rely on Rigid formulas to define whether an order suspicious and that and they give for example A system that defines identifies otters as suspicious only in a total amount of the control systems are during one month  Well that and I frison misunderstanding what you re asking  Well  let me phrase this another way  So you have three potential options Option 1 is you would have you would base your Som system on just look just comparing the current order to the previous month s order and your understanding is that the DEA disapproved of that approach they show that as an example the other Approach would be you know  what you did what Mallinckrodt did which is to compare the current order to the average of the past 12 months on a rolling basis accurate  correct  Another approach would be in addition to looking at you know  in addition to comparing the current order to the prior twelve months order on a rolling basis  You could also look at other factors  for example  the factors identified in the 2006 letter so So  you know  What are they what are they ordering relative how much or how much opiates are the ordering relative to other products  Is there is there a pattern with respect to you know how often that they are  They are providing an order that would for example trigger The Peculiar order threshold are the ordering excessive quantities of controlled substances in combination with you know  I think sets of quantities of Lifestyle drugs  So you could have a suspicious order monitoring program that had both this formula in addition to other factors  Well keeping keep in mind that As the ball customer service rep at that time what the DAR field office was requiring as what we were supplying we gave him what what we had is our criteria  which I just told you it was based upon a 12 month rolling average  They approve that and we had that system in place up until 2007 2008 which time they said that was no longer going to be valid and that s when we started developing our enhanced program  So regardless of what they have here what our requirements were at the time was what I just told you And do you know is it is this the same system that was in place regarding dosage products for the eye are the pre 2007 time period I believe so  but that s a question that I would refer to Kathy Stewart who had at the same time  Okay  And so if I understand your testimony this formula  which was based on looking comparing the current order to the prior 12 month rolling period that formula was changed after 2007 when you took over the role of dosage products  Yes  Okay  And what was what what was the change or how was it changed  What was our new program  Yes  Okay  I don t remember all the particulars but because it s been a long period of time with the input of Kathy and several other people  It was based upon not only the order quantity on a rolling average  It was based upon not a not only on a particular skew but I ll call this Q which was a particular size like a 25 tablet bottle versus a 50 tablet bottle  They each would be separate skews  So just not looking at the Auditors for those particular ones if they were within what we call the same family  We will look at the total of that family  So what we wanted to make sure as far as diversion is that to keep somebody from trying to get something by us is 21 month order to 50 tab bottle and then the next month ordered a hundred tab bottles  So we were looking at the combined of that family combination of that family and that would be flagged it regular or Patterns was added which I think is talked about in here and number of different things and I m sorry when you re talking about the 50 versus 100 tabs what you re referring to is tablet bottles tablet bottles  So ordering 50 tablet bottles from one family and then ordering 100 tablet bottles from another family or do the same family  Okay  So let s let s say hi  Hydrocodone example  let s say they came in size bottles of 50 tablets or 100 tablets  Okay  but they all came from the same  Crude  okay are what we would call Family  Alright  so if somebody came in and ordered 100 one month  then came back the next month in ordered 50 the the computer system would keep track of that and look at it at the higher level of where that Was coming from in the in the crude  It would look at the total combination or combine reels it was essentially looking at the number of pivot  It was taking into account  The number of pills them that dosage correct postage a crack  You know  how many pills were exempt bottles  right  Okay Okay  so why don t we turn two  like to Mark as believer up to exhibit 5 Okay  and so I ve marked as exhibit five  It s a PowerPoint  It s dated June 5th 2008 because I ve got it printed in Native form  I m going to read the Bates number into the record  So the Bates number for this is M and K 2 T 1 2 2 5 0 0 for 6 So  mr  Rauch  I d like you to quickly review this PowerPoint and let me know when you re when you re done Okay  So this is a PowerPoint dated June 5th 2008 and it s entitled introductory training for field sales  Have you seen this PowerPoint before I believe I have did you help prepare this know is prepared by Karen Harper  I believe but you ve reviewed this before I ve seen it before and did you work with Karen Harper on preparing this  No  I don t believe so  So turning the page 3 of the PowerPoint it says Mallinckrodt suspicious order monitoring procedure team  Okay that paid yes  I do  Who is Joanne lip leaving or Levy  Joanne Levy is the was the VP of logistics  And so did everyone else report up to her  No  Bill see Michael Feeney did I did Kathy did  Bill Ratliff I believe did John Adams didn t Karen Harper  I m not sure if she did or didn t at that time it she her reporting relationship changed  but I don t remember what the time period was  So at one time all it didn t at one time she did report to join Levy or I don t remember what a reporting relationship was at that time  And so in terms of compliance issues the people that would have been involved with the compliance side of the program  Well  could you identify for the peep for me the people on this team that would have been involved in the compliance issues well  As far as my customer service would be myself and Kathy Sue Marlatt from the credit and collections department  They would be involved as far as setting up the customer and doing the credit background checks on on them  Who else we got  We are reported in to well  not all Kathy and I set myself reported in no Michael Feeny Kimberly France  I don t remember her  And who was responsible for making sure that the program and the policies comply with the DEA regulations and applicable law  That would be Karen Harper  Now there are team advisors listed at the bottom of the page  right  Do you know what role they played  Their role was to enforce what the otter miring Pursuit team rolled out  They were at a higher level  The this presentation was given and Jerry Moss was the Vice President of Sales for the bulk division  And Jason Jones mature  but he was over one of the sales organization and same with Jeff bird  He was marketing Bob lesnick was in sales over to method on area I believe and then Eileen Spaulding was again  She reported in the Karen Harper as you indicated that their will was to enforce what the monitoring procedure so they did they help develop them or when I when I say enforced to make sure that this was rolled out to our salespeople and what what happened here or what occurred was every year the the Salesforce would get together for a week long period of time to go over different things that we re going on in sales and then something like this would Rolled out by Karen during that week just to instruct them on what the new d a regular with the DEA regulations were what we were doing as far as developing a new program what their role was expected of them in this program and and so forth  And so the person that would have been responsible for making sure that the suspicious order monitoring program complied with the DEA requirements with Karen Harper  She d be the yes  and so she would have been the one that spoke to the DA about this program  She probably tried to she as she would notify them  But the DEA did not say one word way or the other whether they liked it or they didn t approve it or disapprove of the they stayed out of that as far as I remember now didn t recommend a program and Didn t say whether our approved programs as far as I know  but if they had concerns they would let Mallinckrodt no  Well  Yes  Yes  Did this team have Team meetings  Yes  and it s someone take notes at those meetings  I don t remember  I don t remember  Was there any type of secretary for these meetings  you know  did this team have any Central files  I don t remember  Most of the teams in this I don t see the CI everybody was given assignments what was needed to be done and we work on our assignments and meet on a frequent basis to see where we were as far as coming up with the the new suspicious are reporting system  And who was the team leader  I believe it was Karen  She would have been the one giving out assignments and making sure that they were completed  Is that correct  Well  she wouldn t  Give out assignments during the meeting  We would all talk about what we wanted to see and based upon what person was involved in that particular area  They would go back and work on that say for it  We ask them to take a look at it meaning Information Services our computer people  Okay  we would ask them to see  you know  can this be implemented into the system so they would go back and Their due diligence on whether that be can be done Kathy and I would be would take a look at you know  what was possible on our end to get done  So everybody was given assignments and then we come back and talk about what we had come up with are done  And so they went well strike that do  you know when this team was first formed  not the exact timeframe this was Probably June 2008 probably earlier in that time frame since we kind of details out a little bit what we re going to be looking at probably early 2008 maybe late 2007 and was this team in existence for your entire time between 2008 and 2013  Now this was just to roll out our new monitoring system  What I I had control I had part of the suspicious art of mining program until fall of 2010 then it was turned over to another group  As far as being the one that would follow up on our peculiar otters in that and in Fall 2010  Do you know who it was turned over to  Tiffany I don t see her name here  I do not remember her last name  And was she in a different group  She was what group was she in I believe chargebacks  So if you turn to the next page page for says d a policy on suspicious orders  and one of the bullet points is registrant is reminded that the responsibility does not end merely with the filing of suspicious order report  Correct  What what is that mean to you that s referring to the report that we were sending  on a monthly basis and so what are your additional responsibilities other than 5 well track that what are the responsibilities you have after filing your suspicious order report  Well  not only after five but during the interim remember this was a month to month report that we filed in it was at the end of the month  So during the month are our responsibilities were to continue to look at the otters  and over I report to see if there was unusual otter activity are unusual ours being placed at we were out of the norm for that particular customer as I talked about earlier to this morning on the bulk side are csr s had a good feel of who our customers were we dealt with them for years and and there wasn t that many distributors in that that were our drug manufacturers at that time  So we had a pretty good idea of what their order patterns were  And that so if we felt something was unusual or whatever we bring that up to the business manager for the product and are the sales person  And when did you become when did you when were you placed in charge of the dosage products 2008 2008 so fall of 2008 and believe so would have been after this presentation  A couple months after yes  and so with respect to this bullet point and your responsibilities on the dosage side of Mallinckrodt business  What what additional responsibilities did you have other than filing the suspicious order report  On the bulk side  No on the dosage side  Well at that time I did not have any responsibilities  I m sorry  Well  then you ve got a bullet point here that says register on is reminded that the responsibility does not end merely with the filing of this was a Kathy  This would be Kathy Stewart s responsibility understood  But this requirement would also have applied to you when you took over the dosage side of the business correct after our after our Reporting system was put in place  So what additional responsibilities after the new Reporting System gets put in place  Okay  what additional responsibilities did you have other than filing the suspicious order report  We no longer file that report our new monitoring system took the place of that  the da didn t no longer wanted us to Send that report  so during their time period of 2000 and late 2008 and 2009  We worked on our and this is discussed in this presentation this team that was put together worked on coming out with a new report my responsibilities after it was put in place was to receive the daily reports peculiar  Reports that flag the orders that were out of the logarithms of the normal order patterning  Okay and my job  which I think I kind of discussed earlier was to the orders that were flagged was to then talk to the csr s the business managers and the sales force that were involved with this particular customer that we were selling to and trying to explain why the otter pattern was not being fouled or why this was an unusual or peculiar order  And so well  so when did this enhance Som policy become effective  I believe it was in the fall of 2009 is when we put it in place  This is after after months of working on what we wanted to see in the report  This is after we tested put it in a test mode and ran the parallel with our order entry system to see if there was anything kicking out  Shouldn t been and then we put it in what I call live production and so prior to 2009 what policy and procedures were in place regarding dosage products  Just our normal due diligence of the DEA requirements of making sure that we had the two two two forms prior to the art of being shipped all orders were placed on hold prior to that farm being received  So that was our policy and you did you have any Policy or process in place to identify suspicious dosage orders between the fall of 2008 in the fall of 2009 as I discussed just our normal da compliance with the to two farms in that we were working on the process other than to see us ours bringing up special starters based upon their knowledge  We did not have a suspicious are  G in place at that time as we developed so in let s say we re talking January of 2009 here  Okay a manufacturer  I m sorry a distributor for the dosage products submits an order that is say more than two times what it requested the prior month that would not have been flagged for further review or or investigation  If the CSR notice that it was a larger arter than normal based upon past history  which we had on our computer  They would bring it to the attention of the sales person or business manager for approval to ship it and was there a threshold that was being applied or how was CSR to know that this was an unusually large order just from past the otter history that was on the sales on the computer  And so any order that was larger than the past sales history or did it have to be larger by a certain amount  There wasn t a formal programming process as this as this suspicious  Our thing points out  We were in the process of coming up with a new program  So From that standpoint  We didn t have a computer system that was doing it  It was just informal  So I just want to make sure I understand the chronology here  So prior to 2008 for the dosage products  What was the formula that was applied to determine if there were if an order with suspicious or not prior to 2008 to my best of my knowledge because I was in the bulk area  They were reporting the best of the same way that I was which was a monthly report  And that is they would look at the current month s report  I m sorry  They would look at the current order and compare it to the prior month rolling 12 miles of rolling 12 month basis  And what was the threshold that would trigger it being viewed as suspicious the average of that 12 month  So two times that 2 times that okay  so prior to 2008 on the dose and let me let me qualify  And I just got over that program at the time  I was not in dosage  but I believe that s what they were using but I can t say for sure that question should be asked of Kathy Stewart understood but to the best of your knowledge prior to 2008 the formula that was in place regarding dosage products was that you looked at the current order and compared it to the 12 month rolling average and if that order was more than two times the 12 month rolling average that would be flagged as a peculiar order  I m assuming that s what they were doing  That s what we did on the bulk side and then in 2000 in late 2008 when you assumed control of the dosage products have you the after the program was the new after the program was placed in 23rd Place put in place  But before the new formula was developed you didn t have a formula in place at all  Correct  So you just got rid of the you no longer looked at the comparison between the current order and the 12 month rolling app to the DA asked us  To just continue sending them out letter  Well  I understand that the DA has asked you to had asked you to discontinue sending them the report  but did they also tell you that you didn t need to look at that data anymore  I don t remember  But nevertheless that that that that formula was discontinued and until fall of 2009 nothing replaced it is that correct object to the form  That s correct  So between the fall of 2008 and the fall of 2009 your regulatory system was well shrink that Between the fall of 2008 on the fall of 2009 the only regulatory the only regulatory requirement that you had in place to guard against diversion for dosage products was the two two two forms  You say when you say only it was the part of the DEA requirement program that We have to to to farms and quota forms required that and to make say only kind of I think many sizes are is playing it down that it was not an important part of the DEA regulations  We still we had that requirement and keep in mind  We were we were shipping to distribute Distributors who also He had requirements on having programs in place  We were not shipping to the end users were there was many layers of other players in this in this might want some say I shouldn t say players  but other people are companies that were involved in the suspicious order process besides Maryland crop  So did you say yes  we did not have a program in place at the time  The da was well aware that we did not have a suspicious order program in place  They asked us to put one in place and we kept them in form  And when I say we care and Harper kept them informed on the progress of developing the new program and to my knowledge they were fine with that  But nevertheless if you were to compare January of 2008 with January of 2009 the regulatory requirements in effect on January of 2009 would be less than the regulatory effects in January of 2010 the regulatory requirements for January of 2008  That s correct  I would have to agree  Yes  Why was it important to have strike that  with respect to the pre enhanced Som program You know well strike that why did Mallinckrodt have this 12 month rolling this two times a 12 month rolling average standard in place  What was its purpose  All the da asked us to report on a monthly basis to them suspicious otters what they called suspicious order to develop a program  which I described to you and to send that to them on a monthly basis  And this was in addition to the 222 form requirement  correct  The quota Farm  Yes  So why what was the benefit of this added regulatory requirement given that you have the quota for in place  I can t answer that  That s a that s the question that you d have to ask  The DEA are Karen Harper  But you would agree that this was this is what was asked of us  We came up with a formula and I think you can even see the that we submitted to them and they approved as far as the monthly reporting basis and that s what we went with well  so it s 12 30 now Rocky  Did you want to take a break for lunch  Okay  So do you want to come back at  15 130  Okay  that s fine ,0.84026571787037041,Nov 16  2018 12 12 46PM Nov 16  2018 12 03 35PM Nov 16  2018 12 14 51PM Nov 16  2018 11 56

speaking,conversation,facial expression,speech,sitting",,So mr  Rauch directing you to exhibit for again  It s a 2070 a letter  Do you have that in front of me  Yes  So looking on the back page on the top paragraph and we discussed this briefly during the last session  Okay  you see the top paragraph where it says registrants that rely on Rigid formulas to define whether an order of suspicious may be failing to detect suspicious orders  Yes and your interpretation of that requirement  Is that you couldn t just rely on the month before is that accurate  Well  I think that s what they re saying here  For example A system that identifies otters and suspicious only if the total amount of control 7s are during one month exceeds the amount order to previous month  Okay  and so I thought you know that I interpret as being rigid  And so it would be improper to just look at one month  But if you were to look at the past two months  that would be okay  Is that your interpretation  No  no  Okay  Well what I m saying is what we what we did is we looked at a 12 month  Roving period of time as I explained earlier where we not only looked at the previous month and the month before that and six months before that  but I years basis  so if they placed an order for example in April  okay  what we looked at were otters it had been placed from say March of that year the month before through  The past March of the previous year and so and that then that just kept changing if daughter was placed in may we look from April to April  Does that make sense  I believe I understand that I okay question is so your your your understanding of what it means not to rely on a rigid  Formula is that your formula shouldn t be time limited essentially in one month  Is that so what I think that s what might our interpretations was what the da is saying there  Don t just look at one what they bought the previous month because that s not going to give you a good feel for Our a order pattern that is deviant from possibly past otters and what it what is your basis for that interpretation  Just thought that was the better approach than just looking at one month and from Reading here  It says okay should not rely on Rigid formulas to define whether an order suspicious and that and they give for example A system that defines identifies otters as suspicious only in a total amount of the control systems are during one month  Well that and I frison misunderstanding what you re asking  Well  let me phrase this another way  So you have three potential options Option 1 is you would have you would base your Som system on just look just comparing the current order to the previous month s order and your understanding is that the DEA disapproved of that approach they show that as an example the other Approach would be you know  what you did what Mallinckrodt did which is to compare the current order to the average of the past 12 months on a rolling basis accurate  correct  Another approach would be in addition to looking at you know  in addition to comparing the current order to the prior twelve months order on a rolling basis  You could also look at other factors  for example  the factors identified in the 2006 letter so So  you know  What are they what are they ordering relative how much or how much opiates are the ordering relative to other products  Is there is there a pattern with respect to you know how often that they are  They are providing an order that would for example trigger The Peculiar order threshold are the ordering excessive quantities of controlled substances in combination with you know  I think sets of quantities of Lifestyle drugs  So you could have a suspicious order monitoring program that had both this formula in addition to other factors  Well keeping keep in mind that As the ball customer service rep at that time what the DAR field office was requiring as what we were supplying we gave him what what we had is our criteria  which I just told you it was based upon a 12 month rolling average  They approve that and we had that system in place up until 2007 2008 which time they said that was no longer going to be valid and that s when we started developing our enhanced program  So regardless of what they have here what our requirements were at the time was what I just told you And do you know is it is this the same system that was in place regarding dosage products for the eye are the pre 2007 time period I believe so  but that s a question that I would refer to Kathy Stewart who had at the same time  Okay  And so if I understand your testimony this formula  which was based on looking comparing the current order to the prior 12 month rolling period that formula was changed after 2007 when you took over the role of dosage products  Yes  Okay  And what was what what was the change or how was it changed  What was our new program  Yes  Okay  I don t remember all the particulars but because it s been a long period of time with the input of Kathy and several other people  It was based upon not only the order quantity on a rolling average  It was based upon not a not only on a particular skew but I ll call this Q which was a particular size like a 25 tablet bottle versus a 50 tablet bottle  They each would be separate skews  So just not looking at the Auditors for those particular ones if they were within what we call the same family  We will look at the total of that family  So what we wanted to make sure as far as diversion is that to keep somebody from trying to get something by us is 21 month order to 50 tab bottle and then the next month ordered a hundred tab bottles  So we were looking at the combined of that family combination of that family and that would be flagged it regular or Patterns was added which I think is talked about in here and number of different things and I m sorry when you re talking about the 50 versus 100 tabs what you re referring to is tablet bottles tablet bottles  So ordering 50 tablet bottles from one family and then ordering 100 tablet bottles from another family or do the same family  Okay  So let s let s say hi  Hydrocodone example  let s say they came in size bottles of 50 tablets or 100 tablets  Okay  but they all came from the same  Crude  okay are what we would call Family  Alright  so if somebody came in and ordered 100 one month  then came back the next month in ordered 50 the the computer system would keep track of that and look at it at the higher level of where that Was coming from in the in the crude  It would look at the total combination or combine reels it was essentially looking at the number of pivot  It was taking into account  The number of pills them that dosage correct postage a crack  You know  how many pills were exempt bottles  right  Okay Okay  so why don t we turn two  like to Mark as believer up to exhibit 5 Okay  and so I ve marked as exhibit five  It s a PowerPoint  It s dated June 5th 2008 because I ve got it printed in Native form  I m going to read the Bates number into the record  So the Bates number for this is M and K 2 T 1 2 2 5 0 0 for 6 So  mr  Rauch  I d like you to quickly review this PowerPoint and let me know when you re when you re done Okay  So this is a PowerPoint dated June 5th 2008 and it s entitled introductory training for field sales  Have you seen this PowerPoint before I believe I have did you help prepare this know is prepared by Karen Harper  I believe but you ve reviewed this before I ve seen it before and did you work with Karen Harper on preparing this  No  I don t believe so  So turning the page 3 of the PowerPoint it says Mallinckrodt suspicious order monitoring procedure team  Okay that paid yes  I do  Who is Joanne lip leaving or Levy  Joanne Levy is the was the VP of logistics  And so did everyone else report up to her  No  Bill see Michael Feeney did I did Kathy did  Bill Ratliff I believe did John Adams didn t Karen Harper  I m not sure if she did or didn t at that time it she her reporting relationship changed  but I don t remember what the time period was  So at one time all it didn t at one time she did report to join Levy or I don t remember what a reporting relationship was at that time  And so in terms of compliance issues the people that would have been involved with the compliance side of the program  Well  could you identify for the peep for me the people on this team that would have been involved in the compliance issues well  As far as my customer service would be myself and Kathy Sue Marlatt from the credit and collections department  They would be involved as far as setting up the customer and doing the credit background checks on on them  Who else we got  We are reported in to well  not all Kathy and I set myself reported in no Michael Feeny Kimberly France  I don t remember her  And who was responsible for making sure that the program and the policies comply with the DEA regulations and applicable law  That would be Karen Harper  Now there are team advisors listed at the bottom of the page  right  Do you know what role they played  Their role was to enforce what the otter miring Pursuit team rolled out  They were at a higher level  The this presentation was given and Jerry Moss was the Vice President of Sales for the bulk division  And Jason Jones mature  but he was over one of the sales organization and same with Jeff bird  He was marketing Bob lesnick was in sales over to method on area I believe and then Eileen Spaulding was again  She reported in the Karen Harper as you indicated that their will was to enforce what the monitoring procedure so they did they help develop them or when I when I say enforced to make sure that this was rolled out to our salespeople and what what happened here or what occurred was every year the the Salesforce would get together for a week long period of time to go over different things that we re going on in sales and then something like this would Rolled out by Karen during that week just to instruct them on what the new d a regular with the DEA regulations were what we were doing as far as developing a new program what their role was expected of them in this program and and so forth  And so the person that would have been responsible for making sure that the suspicious order monitoring program complied with the DEA requirements with Karen Harper  She d be the yes  and so she would have been the one that spoke to the DA about this program  She probably tried to she as she would notify them  But the DEA did not say one word way or the other whether they liked it or they didn t approve it or disapprove of the they stayed out of that as far as I remember now didn t recommend a program and Didn t say whether our approved programs as far as I know  but if they had concerns they would let Mallinckrodt no  Well  Yes  Yes  Did this team have Team meetings  Yes  and it s someone take notes at those meetings  I don t remember  I don t remember  Was there any type of secretary for these meetings  you know  did this team have any Central files  I don t remember  Most of the teams in this I don t see the CI everybody was given assignments what was needed to be done and we work on our assignments and meet on a frequent basis to see where we were as far as coming up with the the new suspicious are reporting system  And who was the team leader  I believe it was Karen  She would have been the one giving out assignments and making sure that they were completed  Is that correct  Well  she wouldn t  Give out assignments during the meeting  We would all talk about what we wanted to see and based upon what person was involved in that particular area  They would go back and work on that say for it  We ask them to take a look at it meaning Information Services our computer people  Okay  we would ask them to see  you know  can this be implemented into the system so they would go back and Their due diligence on whether that be can be done Kathy and I would be would take a look at you know  what was possible on our end to get done  So everybody was given assignments and then we come back and talk about what we had come up with are done  And so they went well strike that do  you know when this team was first formed  not the exact timeframe this was Probably June 2008 probably earlier in that time frame since we kind of details out a little bit what we re going to be looking at probably early 2008 maybe late 2007 and was this team in existence for your entire time between 2008 and 2013  Now this was just to roll out our new monitoring system  What I I had control I had part of the suspicious art of mining program until fall of 2010 then it was turned over to another group  As far as being the one that would follow up on our peculiar otters in that and in Fall 2010  Do you know who it was turned over to  Tiffany I don t see her name here  I do not remember her last name  And was she in a different group  She was what group was she in I believe chargebacks  So if you turn to the next page page for says d a policy on suspicious orders  and one of the bullet points is registrant is reminded that the responsibility does not end merely with the filing of suspicious order report  Correct  What what is that mean to you that s referring to the report that we were sending  on a monthly basis and so what are your additional responsibilities other than 5 well track that what are the responsibilities you have after filing your suspicious order report  Well  not only after five but during the interim remember this was a month to month report that we filed in it was at the end of the month  So during the month are our responsibilities were to continue to look at the otters  and over I report to see if there was unusual otter activity are unusual ours being placed at we were out of the norm for that particular customer as I talked about earlier to this morning on the bulk side are csr s had a good feel of who our customers were we dealt with them for years and and there wasn t that many distributors in that that were our drug manufacturers at that time  So we had a pretty good idea of what their order patterns were  And that so if we felt something was unusual or whatever we bring that up to the business manager for the product and are the sales person  And when did you become when did you when were you placed in charge of the dosage products 2008 2008 so fall of 2008 and believe so would have been after this presentation  A couple months after yes  and so with respect to this bullet point and your responsibilities on the dosage side of Mallinckrodt business  What what additional responsibilities did you have other than filing the suspicious order report  On the bulk side  No on the dosage side  Well at that time I did not have any responsibilities  I m sorry  Well  then you ve got a bullet point here that says register on is reminded that the responsibility does not end merely with the filing of this was a Kathy  This would be Kathy Stewart s responsibility understood  But this requirement would also have applied to you when you took over the dosage side of the business correct after our after our Reporting system was put in place  So what additional responsibilities after the new Reporting System gets put in place  Okay  what additional responsibilities did you have other than filing the suspicious order report  We no longer file that report our new monitoring system took the place of that  the da didn t no longer wanted us to Send that report  so during their time period of 2000 and late 2008 and 2009  We worked on our and this is discussed in this presentation this team that was put together worked on coming out with a new report my responsibilities after it was put in place was to receive the daily reports peculiar  Reports that flag the orders that were out of the logarithms of the normal order patterning  Okay and my job  which I think I kind of discussed earlier was to the orders that were flagged was to then talk to the csr s the business managers and the sales force that were involved with this particular customer that we were selling to and trying to explain why the otter pattern was not being fouled or why this was an unusual or peculiar order  And so well  so when did this enhance Som policy become effective  I believe it was in the fall of 2009 is when we put it in place  This is after after months of working on what we wanted to see in the report  This is after we tested put it in a test mode and ran the parallel with our order entry system to see if there was anything kicking out  Shouldn t been and then we put it in what I call live production and so prior to 2009 what policy and procedures were in place regarding dosage products  Just our normal due diligence of the DEA requirements of making sure that we had the two two two forms prior to the art of being shipped all orders were placed on hold prior to that farm being received  So that was our policy and you did you have any Policy or process in place to identify suspicious dosage orders between the fall of 2008 in the fall of 2009 as I discussed just our normal da compliance with the to two farms in that we were working on the process other than to see us ours bringing up special starters based upon their knowledge  We did not have a suspicious are  G in place at that time as we developed so in let s say we re talking January of 2009 here  Okay a manufacturer  I m sorry a distributor for the dosage products submits an order that is say more than two times what it requested the prior month that would not have been flagged for further review or or investigation  If the CSR notice that it was a larger arter than normal based upon past history  which we had on our computer  They would bring it to the attention of the sales person or business manager for approval to ship it and was there a threshold that was being applied or how was CSR to know that this was an unusually large order just from past the otter history that was on the sales on the computer  And so any order that was larger than the past sales history or did it have to be larger by a certain amount  There wasn t a formal programming process as this as this suspicious  Our thing points out  We were in the process of coming up with a new program  So From that standpoint  We didn t have a computer system that was doing it  It was just informal  So I just want to make sure I understand the chronology here  So prior to 2008 for the dosage products  What was the formula that was applied to determine if there were if an order with suspicious or not prior to 2008 to my best of my knowledge because I was in the bulk area  They were reporting the best of the same way that I was which was a monthly report  And that is they would look at the current month s report  I m sorry  They would look at the current order and compare it to the prior month rolling 12 miles of rolling 12 month basis  And what was the threshold that would trigger it being viewed as suspicious the average of that 12 month  So two times that 2 times that okay  so prior to 2008 on the dose and let me let me qualify  And I just got over that program at the time  I was not in dosage  but I believe that s what they were using but I can t say for sure that question should be asked of Kathy Stewart understood but to the best of your knowledge prior to 2008 the formula that was in place regarding dosage products was that you looked at the current order and compared it to the 12 month rolling average and if that order was more than two times the 12 month rolling average that would be flagged as a peculiar order  I m assuming that s what they were doing  That s what we did on the bulk side and then in 2000 in late 2008 when you assumed control of the dosage products have you the after the program was the new after the program was placed in 23rd Place put in place  But before the new formula was developed you didn t have a formula in place at all  Correct  So you just got rid of the you no longer looked at the comparison between the current order and the 12 month rolling app to the DA asked us  To just continue sending them out letter  Well  I understand that the DA has asked you to had asked you to discontinue sending them the report  but did they also tell you that you didn t need to look at that data anymore  I don t remember  But nevertheless that that that that formula was discontinued and until fall of 2009 nothing replaced it is that correct object to the form  That s correct  So between the fall of 2008 and the fall of 2009 your regulatory system was well shrink that Between the fall of 2008 on the fall of 2009 the only regulatory the only regulatory requirement that you had in place to guard against diversion for dosage products was the two two two forms  You say when you say only it was the part of the DEA requirement program that We have to to to farms and quota forms required that and to make say only kind of I think many sizes are is playing it down that it was not an important part of the DEA regulations  We still we had that requirement and keep in mind  We were we were shipping to distribute Distributors who also He had requirements on having programs in place  We were not shipping to the end users were there was many layers of other players in this in this might want some say I shouldn t say players  but other people are companies that were involved in the suspicious order process besides Maryland crop  So did you say yes  we did not have a program in place at the time  The da was well aware that we did not have a suspicious order program in place  They asked us to put one in place and we kept them in form  And when I say we care and Harper kept them informed on the progress of developing the new program and to my knowledge they were fine with that  But nevertheless if you were to compare January of 2008 with January of 2009 the regulatory requirements in effect on January of 2009 would be less than the regulatory effects in January of 2010 the regulatory requirements for January of 2008  That s correct  I would have to agree  Yes  Why was it important to have strike that  with respect to the pre enhanced Som program You know well strike that why did Mallinckrodt have this 12 month rolling this two times a 12 month rolling average standard in place  What was its purpose  All the da asked us to report on a monthly basis to them suspicious otters what they called suspicious order to develop a program  which I described to you and to send that to them on a monthly basis  And this was in addition to the 222 form requirement  correct  The quota Farm  Yes  So why what was the benefit of this added regulatory requirement given that you have the quota for in place  I can t answer that  That s a that s the question that you d have to ask  The DEA are Karen Harper  But you would agree that this was this is what was asked of us  We came up with a formula and I think you can even see the that we submitted to them and they approved as far as the monthly reporting basis and that s what we went with well  so it s 12 30 now Rocky  Did you want to take a break for lunch  Okay  So do you want to come back at  15 130  Okay  that s fine
